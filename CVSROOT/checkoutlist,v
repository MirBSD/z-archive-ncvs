# administrative files in $CVSROOT/CVSROOT, such as template files.
#
# The first entry on a line is a filename which will be checked out from
# the corresponding RCS file in the $CVSROOT/CVSROOT directory.
# The remainder of the line is an error message to use if the file cannot
# be checked out.
#
# File format:
#
#	[<whitespace>]<filename>[<whitespace><error message>]<end-of-line>
