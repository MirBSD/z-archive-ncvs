@# $MirBSD: CVSROOT/commitinfo,v 2.1 2004/12/10 17:52:15 tg Exp $
#-
# The "commitinfo" file is used to control pre-commit checks.
# The filter on the right is invoked with the repository and a list
# of files to check.  A non-zero exit of the filter program will
# cause the commit to be aborted.
#
# The first entry on a line is a regular expression which is tested
# against the directory that the change is being committed to, relative
# to the $CVSROOT.  For the first match that is found, then the remainder
# of the line is the name of the filter to run.
#
# Format strings present in the filter will be replaced as follows:
#    %p = path relative to repository
#    %r = repository (path portion of $CVSROOT)
#    %{s} = file name, file name, ...
#
# If no format strings are present in the filter string, a default of
# " %r %s" will be appended to the filter string, but this usage is
# deprecated.
#
# If the repository name does not match any of the regular expressions in this
# file, the "DEFAULT" line is used, if it is specified.
#
# If the name "ALL" appears as a regular expression it is always used
# in addition to the first matching regex or "DEFAULT".
