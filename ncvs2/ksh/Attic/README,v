@$MirOS: src/bin/ksh/README,v 1.1 2005/03/06 15:42:53 tg Exp $

This is the README for mirbsdksh, developed as part of the MirBSD
operating system at The MirOS Project, and produced portably.
Legal information is provided about a screenpage farther down.

To build mksh on MirOS, issue 'make obj && make depend && make'.

To build mksh on other operating systems, read Builsd.sh first
or consult http://wiki.mirbsd.de/MirbsdKsh for further infos.

Set the CC, CFLAGS, CPPFLAGS and LDFLAGS environment variables
to your likes. Don't complain if anything doesn't work.


LEGAL INFORMATION

as contained in the "Build.sh" source file in this distribution,
by having the project leader asserting a collective copyright.

The file alloc.c by Marc Espie is provided under a 2-clause BSD licence.

All files from the original pdksh distribution which were not public

Last updated Jul '99 for pdksh-5.2.14.
	(check ftp://ftp.cs.mun.ca:/pub/pdksh/ or
	 http://www.cs.mun.ca/~michael/pdksh/ for new versions/patches)

PD-ksh is a mostly complete AT&T ksh look-alike (see NOTES file for a list
of things not supported).  Work is mostly finished to make it fully
compatible with both POSIX and AT&T ksh (when the two don't conflict).

Since pdksh is free and compiles and runs on most common unix systems, it
is very useful in creating a consistent user interface across multiple
machines.  For example, in the CS dept. of MUN, pdksh is installed on a
variety of machines including Suns, HPs, DecStations, pcs running Linux,
etc., and is the login shell of ~5200 users.

If you would like to be notified via email of new releases as they become
available, send mail to pdksh-request@@cs.mun.ca with subject
"send release notifications" (or "don't send release notifications" to stop
them).

Newer versions of pdksh may be available from
	ftp://ftp.cs.mun.ca:/pub/pdksh/
[...]

You can send bug reports, fixes, and enhancements to pdksh@@cs.mun.ca (please
don't assume I will see bug reports that are posted to some newsgroup or
mailing list - I probably won't).
If you are reporting a bug (with or without a fix), please include
	* the version of pdksh you are using (see version.c, or, if you are
	  running pdksh, try echo $KSH_VERSION),
	* the machine, operating system and compiler you are using,
	* and a description of how to repeat the bug (a small shell
	  script that demonstrates the bug is best).
as well as the following, if relevant (if you aren't sure, include them)
	* what options you are using (both configure options and set -o options)
	* the output of configure, with the verbose flag
	  (eg, make distclean; ./configure --verbose)
	* the contents of config.log (this is created by the configure script)
	* if you are using gcc (the GNU C compiler), which version it is.

BTW, THE MOST FREQUENTLY REPORTED BUG IS
	echo hi | read a; echo $a	# Does not print hi
I'm aware of this and there is no need to report it.

Michael Rendell, michael@@cs.mun.ca
