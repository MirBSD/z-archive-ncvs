@Apache test page, russian translation by Pavel Polischouk <pavelp@@iil.intel.com>
Different russian encodings provided:

 Name		   iconv's codepage

+index.html.dos  - CP-866 aka ibm866; used by DOS and OS/2. 
*index.html.iso  - ISO-8859-5
*index.html.koi  - KOI8-R; used by UNIX flavours and Mac.
 index.html.ucs2 - UCS-2 aka UNICODE aka UNICODEBIG aka UTF-16
 index.html.ucs4 - UCS-4
*index.html.utf8 - UTF-8
*index.html.win  - CP-1251 aka windows-1251 aka MS-CYRILLIC; used by Windows

* - supported by Netscape 4.72. 
+ - Netscape is supposed to support this encoding, but fails to 
read this page on Linux. Should be OK on systems like DOS and OS/2 where this
encoding is the default.
Does anyone need the UCS-2 and UCS-4?@
