log
@Tim Bray says XML 1.1 is not very widely used.
The W3C spec for XML 1.1 says "Programs which generate XML SHOULD generate
XML 1.0, unless one of the specific features of XML 1.1 is required."

So be it, then.

While here, fix roff2htm.sh with regards to the MirBSD.org acquaintance
and the new RCS ID / CVS ID policy.
