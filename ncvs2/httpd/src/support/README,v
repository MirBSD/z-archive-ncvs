@Support files:

ab
	ABuse your server with this benchmarker. Rudimentary
	command line testing tool.

	To compile with SSL support; specify the compile
	time flag 'USE_SSL'. E.g. during configure do:
	
	CFLAGS="-I/usr/local/ssl/include -DUSE_SSL " \
		LIBS="-L/usr/local/ssl/lib -lssl -lcrypt" 
		./configure ...

	SSL support is even more rudimentary and experimental
	than ab itself :-).

	administrator and/or your rc.d scripts to control the 
	functioning of the Apache httpd daemon.

	it to a file. 

logresolve

	This script will take a combined virtual hosts access
	log file and break its contents into separate files.

        see  the  document  `Apache  suEXEC  Support'
	under http://www.apache.org/docs/suexec.html .

	recognize passwords in SHA1 format, as used by Netscape web
