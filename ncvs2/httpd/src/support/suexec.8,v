.Sh NAME
.Nm suexec
.Nd switch user for Apache CGI execution
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm suexec
.Fl V
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is the
.Dq wrapper
support program for the
.Em suexec
behaviour for the Apache
.Xr httpd 8
server.
It is run from within the server automatically to switch the user when
an external program has to be run under a different user.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Fl V
Display the list of compile-time settings used when
.Nm
was built.
No other action is taken.
.El
.Pp
Because this program is only used internally by
.Xr httpd 8 ,
there are no other ways to directly invoke
.Nm .
.Pp
In order to work correctly,
the
.Nm
binary should be owned by
.Dq root
and have the SETUID execution bit set.
.Ox
currently does not install
.Nm
with the SETUID bit set,
so a change of file mode is necessary to enable it:
.Pp
.Dl # chmod u+s /usr/sbin/suexec
.Pp
For more information about
.Nm ,
see the online document
.Dq Apache suEXEC Support
