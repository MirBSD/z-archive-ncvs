@libtool 1.4 -> mirlibtool, back to the state of yesterday night
(so we have a clean 1.4 in the branch LIBTOOL_1_4, and a working
 1.4 in head, which we might switch to LIBTOOL_1_5 once we get it
 working in 2038)

Here is a sample of a session demonstrating this on my system. I show the 
source code, default cc file and three compiles with three a.out file 
sizes. See for yourself:

Script started on Wed Jul  2 11:21:58 1997
$ cat t.c
main()

	{
	printf("Hello, world\n");
	}
$ cat /etc/default/cc

And believe me, this script session is not a fake.

The section of my configure.in script that takes care of shared libraries
is short and not annoying to repeat. You may want to incorporate it into 
the AC_PROG_CC macro or create a new one for it. So far, I've seen only 
two kinds of behaviors regarding shared libraries: if they are not used 
automatically when invoking cc, just include them when linking the 
program. And it worked so far. However, you guys may have a whole lot 
more flavors of system to run on compared to me.

Here is the portion of the shared library check in my configure.in script:

# STEP 2 - Check for libraries

AC_MSG_CHECKING([for libc.so])
if test -r /lib/libc.so; then
    AC_MSG_RESULT([yes (/lib/libc.so)])
    LIBS="$LIBS /lib/libc.so"
elif test -r /usr/lib/libc.so; then
    AC_MSG_RESULT([yes (/usr/lib/libc.so)])
    LIBS="$LIBS /usr/lib/libc.so"
else
    AC_MSG_RESULT(no)
    AC_CHECK_LIB(c_s, main)
    fi

By 'some other Unix systems' requiring that you explicitely specify the 
shared library name when linking the program, I meant specifically:

o Bull Open Software (Unix System V Release 4, but don't remember if it is x86)

o Interactive Unix System V/386 all versions

o SCO Unix 3.2v4 and SCO OpenServer 5

o Sun Solaris 2.3 / SunOS 5.3

All others that we've compiled and run on will automatically use shared 
libraries when available, namely:

IBM's AIX 3.2.* and 4.*
HP's HPUX 8.*, 9.* and 10.*
DEC Ultrix, OSF/1 and DEC Unix all versions tried
DataGeneral's DGUX all versions tried
Sequent's DYNIX/ptx 2.1 and 4
Linux all versions tried
SGI's Irix all versions tried
NCR and AT&T Unix System V/386 Release 4
Sun Solaris 2.4 (SunOS 5.4) and Solaris 2.5 (SunOS 5.5)
SunOS 4.1*
Unisys Unix System V/386
Unixware all versions
