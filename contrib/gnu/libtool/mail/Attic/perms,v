@libtool 1.4 -> mirlibtool, back to the state of yesterday night
(so we have a clean 1.4 in the branch LIBTOOL_1_4, and a working
 1.4 in head, which we might switch to LIBTOOL_1_5 once we get it
 working in 2038)

The second paragraph applies to libtool.  I was recently asked this
same question by the Gtk developers as well.  I don't know the answer;
automake just follows you guys where libtool is concerned.

Two separate problems here. The first, I have complained about before, but
nobody took any interest in fixing it. mkinstalldirs creates directories with
bad permissions. Specifically, it creates directories by just using mkdir and
assuming that they the Public Directory Fairy will come along and make them
755. This does not happen. Please, stop making unwarranted assumptions about
my umask.

The second problem is that automake installs LTLIBRARIES by running libtool
install -m 644 (also known as $INSTALL_DATA). Shared libraries should really
be 755. If you just say "libtool install" without any -m, it will set the
right permissions on installed libraries: 644 for .a's and 755 for .so's.

this is wrong, it was probably just cut&pasted from the rule for
LIBRARIES.  libtools knows what is the right default permission to
assign to libraries, automake doesn't have to do it.  Unless someone
has a good reason to do it.  Maybe automake should define a macro such
as INSTALL_LTLIBRARY, empty by default, but that one could override
with additional arguments for libtool --mode=install

Another alternative, that I don't like very much, is to let libtool
modify the modes of libraries: if they must be executable in the final
target, it just ensures that the installed .so has the executable bit
enabled wherever the read bit is enabled too.

What do you think?

Recently, we've been using a modified version of libtool that enables
shared library dependencies on Linux. With that change, it becomes
desirable to be able to run ldd on the installed libraries.

However, the libraries are installed without executable permissions.

The relevant changelog entry seems to be:

Tue Nov 25 14:20:42 1997  Tom Tromey  <tromey@@cygnus.com>

	* ltlib.am: Use INSTALL_DATA, not INSTALL_PROGRAM.  From Gord
	Matzigkeit.

Do you happen to remember why this change was made?

Thanks,
                                        Owen
