@libtool 1.4 -> mirlibtool, back to the state of yesterday night
(so we have a clean 1.4 in the branch LIBTOOL_1_4, and a working
 1.4 in head, which we might switch to LIBTOOL_1_5 once we get it
 working in 2038)

It seems you are right.  Nor can I find reference anywhere except in the
documentation of both libtool and automake.  However, I stopped using
these variables a few months ago (just forgot to include them really),
and have suffered no ill effects.

Yes, that makes sense.  Or rather, automake should do this for us if it
sees we are using ansi2knr.

Agreed.

In my experience, Tom is very good about applying patches he receives.

This probably needs to be fixed in all of auto{make,conf} and libtool
simultaneously.  I don't have time to look at it right now, but I can
certainly add it to the libtool TODO if you are also busy.

Cheers,
	Gary.

I might have a look, but it is sure safer to write it down somewhere :)

Also, since this is getting more and more tricky, and since I don't
find it's real fun to write down

	LIBOBJS="$LIBOBJS blah.${ac_objext}"

we could introduce in Autoconf a macro taking care of this, no?
Something like

AC_LIBOBJS(blah)

That sounds like a good, general, solution to me.  I'm adding this mail
to the libtool mail archive too =)O|

We are teetering on the edge of a 1.3 release, which must be compatible
with autoconf-2.13 and automake-1.4.  After that, I will try to submit a
patch to Ben (stop me if you have this in your pending queue!).

Agreed.

Cheers,
        Gary.
