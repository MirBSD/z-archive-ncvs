@libtool 1.4 -> mirlibtool, back to the state of yesterday night
(so we have a clean 1.4 in the branch LIBTOOL_1_4, and a working
 1.4 in head, which we might switch to LIBTOOL_1_5 once we get it
 working in 2038)

Yep, some days ago the libtool maintainer asked about details what
need to be done in this area.

I guess, the main reason for the problems is inconsistent usage of
`-Wl,-rpath,somedir' vs. LD_RUN_PATH; AFAIK, `-Wl,-rpath,...' disables 
LD_RUN_PATH at linktime and LD_LIBRARY_PATH at runtime.

I don't know, which way libtool is using, but I tend to strongly
recommend against using -Wl,-rpath.

Other thoughts?

   I guess, the main reason for the problems is inconsistent usage of
   `-Wl,-rpath,somedir' vs. LD_RUN_PATH; AFAIK, `-Wl,-rpath,...' disables 
   LD_RUN_PATH at linktime and LD_LIBRARY_PATH at runtime.

Using -rpath will indeed cause the linker to ignore LD_RUN_PATH (at
least, that is how the GNU linker behaves).  However, it does not
cause the dynamic linker to ignore LD_LIBRARY_PATH when the executable
is run.
