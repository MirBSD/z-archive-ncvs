@libtool 1.4 -> mirlibtool, back to the state of yesterday night
(so we have a clean 1.4 in the branch LIBTOOL_1_4, and a working
 1.4 in head, which we might switch to LIBTOOL_1_5 once we get it
 working in 2038)

@This is a short demo of the fortran support in libtool.

fprogram is a pure-fortran program which is linked 
against the fortran-only library libfoo.la

cprogram is a C program, which is linked against the
mixed C and fortran library libmix.la. The program
calls a C function, which in turn calls a fortran 
function.

This demo requires GNU autoconf, automake, 
libtool with the F77 tag and quite obvious Fortran 77.
