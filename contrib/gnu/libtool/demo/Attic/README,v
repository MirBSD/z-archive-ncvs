@This is GNU hell, an example package that uses GNU libtool with an
Automake-generated environment to build a simple library and program.

Admittedly, it would be better if this was a more realistic example,
say, a program that actually did something useful, but we can't have
everything.

Send bug reports and comments about GNU hell to the libtool mailing
list <bug-libtool@@gnu.org>.
