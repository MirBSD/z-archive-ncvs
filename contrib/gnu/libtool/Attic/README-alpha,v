@libtool 1.4 -> mirlibtool, back to the state of yesterday night
(so we have a clean 1.4 in the branch LIBTOOL_1_4, and a working
 1.4 in head, which we might switch to LIBTOOL_1_5 once we get it
 working in 2038)

@This is an alpha testing release of GNU Libtool.  To get the latest
CVS version of this package, do:

  export CVS_RSH=ssh
  cvs -z3 -d :ext:anoncvs@@savannah.gnu.org:/cvsroot/libtool co libtool
  cd libtool
  ./bootstrap

The `bootstrap' script sets up the source directory for you to hack. To
use it, you need a recent (maybe yet to be released) version of both
Autoconf and Automake.

If you have any suggestions or bug reports, or you wish to port
libtool to a new platform, please send electronic mail to the libtool
mailing list <libtool@@gnu.org> or bug reports to <bug-libtool@@gnu.org>.
Don't forget to mention the version of libtool that you are currently
using (by typing `libtool --version').

================================================================
= Administrivia

* If you incorporate a change from somebody on the net:
  If it is a large change, you must make sure they have signed the
  appropriate paperwork, and be sure to add their name and email
  address to THANKS

* If a change fixes a test, mention the test in the ChangeLog entry.

* If somebody reports a new bug, mention his name in the ChangeLog entry
  and in the test case you write.

* The correct response to most actual bugs is to write a new test case
  which demonstrates the bug.  Then fix the bug, re-run the test suite,
  and check everything in.

* Some files in the libtool package are not owned by libtool.  These
  files should never be edited here.  These files are:
	COPYING
	INSTALL
	config/
	    + config.guess
	    + config.sub
	    + depcomp
	    + install-sh
	    + mdate-sh
	    + missing
	    + texinfo.tex
	doc/
	    + fdl.texi
	libltdl/
	    + COPYING.LESSER
	    + config.guess
	    + config.sub
	    + install-sh
	    + missing

* Changes other than bug fixes must be mentioned in NEWS

================================================================
= Test suite

* Use "make check" liberally, on as many platforms as you can.  Use as
  many compilers and linkers you can.


================================================================
= Release procedure

* If you are a libtool maintainer, but have not yet registered your
  gpg public key and (preferred) email address with the FSF, send an
  email, preferably GPG-signed, to <ftp-upload@@gnu.org> that includes
  the following:

    (a) name of package(s) that you are the maintainer for, and your
        preferred email address.

    (b) an ASCII armored copy of your GnuPG key, as an attachment.
	("gpg --export -a YOUR_KEY_ID > mykey.asc" should give you
	this.)

  When you have received acknowledgement of your message, the proper GPG
  keys will be registered on ftp-upload.gnu.org and only then will you be
  authorized to upload files to the FSF ftp machines.

* Update the version number in configure.ac.
  See http://www.gnu.org/software/libtool/contribute.html for details of
  the numbering scheme.

* Update NEWS, ChangeLog.

* Run ./bootstrap.

* Run ./configure and then make.

* Run `make fetch', which will fetch new versions of the files that are
  maintained outside of libtool.

* Run ./commit.

* Run `make cvs-dist' which will build a release tarball (with `make
  distcheck'), tag the tree with release-$(VERSION) and generate the
  gpg signature files.

* Make sure you have a copy of xdelta installed, and a copy of the previous
  release tarball in the build directory.

* Run 'make LASTRELEASE=min.maj[.mic[alpha]] deltas' to create both diff
  and xdelta files between the previous release tarball and the new with
  detached gpg signature files and clear signed directive files.

* Upload release tarball, diff file and xdelta file, plus their associated
  detached gpg signature files and clear signed directive files to
  ftp-upload.gnu.org.  If the upload is destined for ftp.gnu.org, then the
  files should be placed in the /incoming/ftp directory.  If the upload is
  an alpha release destined for alpha.gnu.org, then the files should be
  placed in the /incoming/alpha directory.

* Send announcement to libtool@@gnu.org and autotools-announce@@gnu.org,
  if not an alpha send to info-gnu@@gnu.org as well.
  
* Update version number in configure.ac to next alpha number.
  See http://www.gnu.org/software/libtool/contribute.html for details of
  the numbering scheme.

* Update NEWS, ChangeLog.

* Run ./commit.

* Update the webpages, libtool.html will need to indicate the latest
  release number and the news page should get a HTMLified copy of your
  release announcement.

* If not an alpha, replace manual.html with the new one
  (generate with cd doc && texi2html libtool.texi)

= Alpha release note template

To: libtool@@gnu.org, autotools-announce@@gnu.org
Subject: GNU Libtool @@VERSION@@ released (alpha release).

The Libtool Team is pleased to announce alpha release @@VERSION@@ of GNU
Libtool.

GNU Libtool hides the complexity of using shared libraries behind a
consistent, portable interface. GNU Libtool ships with GNU libltdl,
which hides the complexity of loading dynamic runtime libraries
(modules) behind a consistent, portable interface.

Here are the compressed sources:

  ftp://alpha.gnu.org/gnu/libtool/libtool-@@VERSION@@.tar.gz

Here are the xdeltas and diffs against libtool-@@PREV_RELEASE_VERSION_ON_THIS_BRANCH@@:

  @@SHA1SUM@@ libtool-@@PREV_RELEASE_VERSION_ON_THIS_BRANCH@@-@@VERSION@@.xdelta

This release has @@SUMMARY_OF_IMPROVEMENTS_SINCE_LAST_RELEASE_ON_THIS_BRANCH@@.

This release was bootstrapped with @@BOOTSTRAP_TOOLS_WITH_VERSIONS@@,
but is useable with @@COMPATIBLE_AUTOTOOL_VERSIONS@@ in your own
projects.

Alternatively, you can fetch the unbootstrapped sourcecode from
anonymous cvs by using the following commands:
 
  $ export CVS_RSH=ssh
  $ cvs -z3 -d :ext:anoncvs@@savannah.gnu.org:/cvsroot/libtool \
  co -r @@CVS_RELEASE_TAG@@ libtool

You will then need to have recent (possibly as yet unreleased) versions
of Automake and Autoconf installed to bootstrap the checked out
sources yourself.
