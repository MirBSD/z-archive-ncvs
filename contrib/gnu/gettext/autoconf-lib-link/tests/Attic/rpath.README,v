@Tests for config.rpath and lib-link.m4.

The rpath-2* tests are sensitive to
  - incomplete shared library support in the system,
  - bugs in libtool that creates the shared libraries,
  - bugs in lib-link.m4.

The rpath-3* tests are sensitive to
  - incomplete shared library support in the system,
  - bugs in libtool that creates the shared libraries.

Known failures:

* On all platforms supporting shared libraries,
    rpath-3aae rpath-3aag
    rpath-3abe rpath-3abg
  fail. This is a libtool 1.4.2 bug: When a shared library depends on a
  static library indirectly through two different dependency paths,
  libtool attempts to link together invalid sets of object files.

* OSF/1 4.0: the tests
    rpath-2bbd
    rpath-3bbd rpath-3bbf rpath-3bbg rpath-3bbh
  fail, because -rpath options are not cumulative:
  The last -rpath option overrides all previous ones. One would need to
  pass all directories, separated by colons, in a single -rpath option.

* Solaris: the tests
    rpath-3bae rpath-3bbe
    rpath-3aaf rpath-3abf
    rpath-3baf rpath-3bbf
  fail, because code from static libraries not compiled with -fPIC cannot
  be integrated into shared libraries: linker error "Text relocation remains".

* Cygwin: The tests
    rpath-2aac rpath-2abc
    rpath-3aac rpath-3aaf
    rpath-3abc rpath-3abf
  fail.
