# eval_gettext MSGID
# looks up the translation of MSGID and substitutes shell variables in the
# result.
eval_gettext () {
  gettext "$1" | (export PATH `envsubst --variables "$1"`; envsubst "$1")
}

# eval_ngettext MSGID MSGID-PLURAL COUNT
# looks up the translation of MSGID / MSGID-PLURAL for COUNT and substitutes
# shell variables in the result.
eval_ngettext () {
  ngettext "$1" "$2" "$3" | (export PATH `envsubst --variables "$1 $2"`; envsubst "$1 $2")
}

# Note: This use of envsubst is much safer than using the shell built-in 'eval'
# would be.
# 1) The security problem with Chinese translations that happen to use a
#    character such as \xe0\x60 is avoided.
# 2) The security problem with malevolent translators who put in command lists
#    like "$(...)" or "`...`" is avoided.
# 3) The translations can only refer to shell variables that are already
#    mentioned in MSGID or MSGID-PLURAL.
#
# Note: "export PATH" above is a dummy; this is for the case when
# `envsubst --variables ...` returns nothing.
#
# Note: In eval_ngettext above, "$1 $2" means a string whose variables set is
# the union of the variables set of "$1" and "$2".
#
# Note: The minimal use of backquote above ensures that trailing newlines are
# not dropped, not from the gettext invocation and not from the value of any
# shell variable.
#
# Note: Field splitting on the `envsubst --variables ...` result is desired,
# since envsubst outputs the variables, separated by newlines. Pathname
# wildcard expansion or tilde expansion has no effect here, since the words
# output by "envsubst --variables ..." consist solely of alphanumeric
# characters and underscore.
