@Version 0.14 - January 2004

* New library: GNU.Gettext.dll contains the runtime for using GNU gettext
  message catalogs in C#.

* Special advice for Norwegian users: The language code for Norwegian
  bokm√•l changed from 'no' to 'nb' recently (in 2003). During the transition
  period, while some message catalogs for this language are installed under
  'nb' and some older ones under 'no', it's recommended for Norwegian users to
  set the LANGUAGE environment variable to 'nb:no' so that both newer and
  older translations are used.

Version 0.13 - November 2003

* On those few platforms (NetBSD and Woe32) for which the native
  printf()/fprintf()/... functions don't support POSIX/XSI format strings
  with positions, replacements are provided through <libintl.h>.

* New function library:
    gettext.sh - shell functions for internationalized shell scripts
* New program:
    envsubst - substitutes environment variables in shell format strings

Version 0.12 - May 2003

* A new C++ class, called gnu::autosprintf, makes it possible to use C format
  strings in C++. This is needed for proper internationalization of C++
  programs.
