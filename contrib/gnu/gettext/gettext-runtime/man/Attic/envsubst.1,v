.SH NAME
envsubst \- substitutes environment variables in shell format strings
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B envsubst
[\fIOPTION\fR] [\fISHELL-FORMAT\fR]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.\" Add any additional description here
.PP
Substitutes the values of environment variables.
.SS "Operation mode:"
.TP
\fB\-v\fR, \fB\-\-variables\fR
output the variables occurring in SHELL-FORMAT
.SS "Informative output:"
.TP
\fB\-h\fR, \fB\-\-help\fR
display this help and exit
.TP
\fB\-V\fR, \fB\-\-version\fR
output version information and exit
.PP
In normal operation mode, standard input is copied to standard output,
with references to environment variables of the form $VARIABLE or ${VARIABLE}
being replaced with the corresponding values.  If a SHELL-FORMAT is given,
only those environment variables that are referenced in SHELL-FORMAT are
substituted; otherwise all environment variables references occurring in
standard input are substituted.
.PP
When \fB\-\-variables\fR is used, standard input is ignored, and the output consists
of the environment variables that are referenced in SHELL-FORMAT, one per line.
