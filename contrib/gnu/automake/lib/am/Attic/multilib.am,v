## These cleaning rules are recursive.  They should not be
## registered as dependencies of *-am rules.  For instance
## otherwise running `make clean' would cause both
## clean-multi and mostlyclean-multi to be run, while only
## clean-multi is really expected (since clean-multi recursively
## call clean, it already do the job of mostlyclean).
