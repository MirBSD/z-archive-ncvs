Usage: compile [--help] [--version] PROGRAM [ARGS]

Wrapper for compilers which do not understand `-c -o'.
Remove `-o dest.o' from ARGS, run PROGRAM with the remaining
arguments, and rename the output as expected.

If you are trying to build a whole package this is not the
right script to run: please start by reading the file `INSTALL'.

Report bugs to <bug-automake@@gnu.org>.
