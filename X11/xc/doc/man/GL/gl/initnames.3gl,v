\- initialize the name stack

.SH C SPECIFICATION
void \f3glInitNames\fP( void )

.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
The name stack is used during selection mode to allow sets of rendering
commands to be uniquely identified.
It consists of an ordered set of unsigned integers.
\%\f3glInitNames\fP causes the name stack to be initialized to its default empty state.
.P
The name stack is always empty while the render mode is not \%\f3GL_SELECT\fP.
Calls to \%\f3glInitNames\fP while the render mode is not \%\f3GL_SELECT\fP are ignored.
.SH ERRORS
\%\f3GL_INVALID_OPERATION\fP is generated if \%\f3glInitNames\fP
is executed between the execution of \%\f3glBegin\fP and the corresponding execution of
\%\f3glEnd\fP.
.SH ASSOCIATED GETS
\%\f3glGet\fP with argument \%\f3GL_NAME_STACK_DEPTH\fP
.br
\%\f3glGet\fP with argument \%\f3GL_MAX_NAME_STACK_DEPTH\fP
