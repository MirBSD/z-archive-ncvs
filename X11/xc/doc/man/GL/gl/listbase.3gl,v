offsets to generate display-list names.
The initial value is 0.

Display-list names are generated by adding \f2base\fP to each offset.
Names that reference valid display lists are executed;
the others are ignored.

\%\f3GL_INVALID_OPERATION\fP is generated if \%\f3glListBase\fP
is executed between the execution of \%\f3glBegin\fP
and the corresponding execution of \%\f3glEnd\fP.
