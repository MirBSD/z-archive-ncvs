.SH Name
XvGrabPort \- lock port for exclusive use by client

.SH Arguments
.\"
.IP \fIdpy\fR 8 
Specifies the display screen on which the
Xv Server is to accept requests from Xv clients.  If the
display option is not specified, Xv uses the display screen
specified by your DISPLAY environment variable.  The display
option has the format hostname:number.  Using two colons
(::) instead of one (:) indicates that DECnet is to be used
for transport.
.IP \fIport\fR 8
Defines the port to be grabbed.
.IP \fItime\fR 8
Specifies the request timestamp.
.\"
.SH Description
.\"
XvGrabPort(3X) grabs a port.  Once a client grabs a port, 
only that client can make video requests
to that port.  
.PP
If the time is before the current port time, the XvGrabPort request is
ignored and XvInvalidTime is returned.  If the port is already grabbed by
another client, XvAlreadyGrabbed is returned. Otherwise it returns a
status of \fISuccess\fR.  The port time is updated when the following
requests are processed: XvGrabPort(3X), XvUngrabPort(3X),
XvPutVideo(3X), XvPutStill(3X), XvGetVideo(3X), XvGetStill(3X).
.PP
If the port is actively processing video for another client, the
video is preempted, and an XvVideoNotify event with detail XvPreempted
is generated for its drawable.
.\"
.SH Returned Values
.IP [Success] 8
Returned if XvGrabPort(3X) completed successfully.
.IP [XvInvalidTime] 8
Returned if requested time is older than the current port time.
.IP [XvAlreadyGrabbed] 8
Returned if the port is already grabbed by another client.
.IP [XvBadExtension] 8
Returned if the Xv extension is unavailable.
.IP [XvBadAlloc] 8
Returned if XvGrabPort(3X) failed to allocate memory to process
the request.
.SH Diagnostics
.IP [XvBadPort] 15
Generated if the requested port does not exist.
