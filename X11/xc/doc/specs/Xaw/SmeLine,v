The SmeLine object is used to add a horizontal line or menu separator to
a menu.  Since each SmeLine is an independent object, the application
is able to change the color, height, and other attributes of the SmeLine
objects on an entry by entry basis.  This object is not selectable, and
will not highlight when the pointer cursor is over it.

.IN "SmeLine object" "resources"

The resources associated with the SmeLine object are defined in this section,
and affect only the single menu entry specified by this object.

.IP \fBforeground\fP 1.5i
A pixel value which indexes the SimpleMenu's colormap to derive the
foreground color used to draw the separator line.
.Hw
Keep in mind that the SimpleMenu widget will force all menu items to
be the width of the widest entry.  Thus, setting the width is generally not
very important.
.Ix
.IP \fBlineWidth\fP 1.5i
The width of the horizontal line that is to be displayed.
.IP \fBstipple\fP 1.5i
If a bitmap is specified for this resource, the line will be stippled
through it.  This allows the menu separator to be rendered as something
more exciting than just a line.  For instance, if you define a stipple
that is a chain link, then your menu separators will look like chains.
