.TH XRANDR 1 "Version 1.0" "XFree86"
.SH NAME
xrandr \- primitive command line interface to RandR extension
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "xrandr"
[-help]  [-display \fIdisplay\fP]
[-o \fIorientation\fP]
[-q] [-v]
[-s \fIsize\fP]
[-x] [-y]
[--screen \fIsnum\fP]
[--verbose]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Xrandr
is used to set the screen size, orientation and/or reflection.
The
.I -s
option is a small integer index used to specify which size the screen should be set to.
To find out what sizes are available, use the
.I -q
option, which reports the sizes available, the current rotation, and
the possible rotations and reflections.
The default size is the first size specified in the list.
The
.I -o
option is used to specify the orientation of the screen,
and can be one of
\fI"normal inverted left right 0 1 2 3"\fP.
.PP
The
.I -x
option instructs the server to reflect the screen on the X axis.
The
.I -y
option instructs the server to reflect the screen on the Y axis.
Reflection is applied after rotation.
.PP
The
.I -help
option prints out a usage summary.
The
.I --verbose
option tells you what xrandr is doing, selects for events, and tells you
when events are received to enable debugging.
