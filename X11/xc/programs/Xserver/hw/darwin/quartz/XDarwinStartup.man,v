.TH XDarwinStartup 1
.SH NAME
XDarwinStartup - Startup program for the XDarwin X window server
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B XDarwinStartup
[\fI-iokit\fP]
[\fI-fullscreen\fP]
[\fI-rootless\fP]
[\fI-quartz\fP]
[\fI-idle\fP]
[\fIoptions\fP]
.SH DESCRIPTION
The \fIXDarwin(1)\fP X window server can be run in a variety of different
modes and is actually two different executables. The IOKit X server,
XDarwin, is used when running from the console. It is most commonly
located in __XBinDir__. The Quartz X server, for running in parallel with
Aqua, is a full-fledged Mac OS X application that can be started from
the Finder. Its application bundle is XDarwin.app, which is typically
located in /Applications.
.I XDarwinStartup
allows easy switching between these X servers and auto-detection of the
appropriate one to use when launching from the command line.
When run without any arguments,
.I XDarwinStartup
will start the Quartz X server if the Core Graphics window server
is currently running. Otherwise it will start the IOKit X server.
.PP
To locate the Quartz X server,
.I XDarwinStartup
will try to read the soft link at __XBinDir__/XDarwinQuartz.
This is typically a soft link to the executable of the XDarwin.app
application. If this fails,
.I XDarwinStartup
will call Launch Services to locate XDarwin.app.
.PP
To start the IOKit X server,
.I XDarwinStartup
will run the XDarwin execuatable, which should be present in the
user's path.
.SH OPTIONS
.I XDarwinStartup
accepts and passes on all options to the X server it
launches. In addition the following options have specific effects:
.TP 8
.B \-iokit

.TP 8
.B \-quartz
