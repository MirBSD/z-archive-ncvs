.TH CONSTYPE 1 __xorgversion__
.SH NAME
constype \- print type of Sun console
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "constype"
[
.I device_name
] [
.B \-num
]
.SH DESCRIPTION
The 
.I constype
program
writes on the standard output the Sun code for the type of display
that the console is.
The types output include these:
.sp 2
.in +0.5i
.nf
bw?	Black and White, where ? is 1-4. (eg) 3-50s are bw2
cg?	Colour Graphics display, where ? is 1-4
gp?	Optional Graphics Processor board, where ? is 1-2
ns?	Not Sun display \(em where ? is A-J
.fi
.in -0.5i
.sp 2
This is useful in determining startup values and defaults for window
systems.
.LP
The
.I device_name
argument, if given, is the device to examine.
If not given,
.I /dev/fb
is used.
.LP
The
.B \-num
option causes
.I constype
to follow the type keyword with the numeric value of that type,
as returned by the FBIOGATTR or FBIOGTYPE ioctl and defined in fbio.h.
This is useful if the type is not recognized by the program.
.SH "EXIT STATUS"
The program exits with status 0 if it identified a known console type,
1 if the type was unknown, and 2 if the device could not be opened or
another error occurred.
.SH BUGS
Not tested on all monitor types
