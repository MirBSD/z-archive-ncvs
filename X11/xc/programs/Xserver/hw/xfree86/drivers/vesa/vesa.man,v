.SH DESCRIPTION
.B vesa
is an XFree86 driver for generic VESA video cards.  It can drive most
VESA-compatible video cards, but only makes use of the basic standard
VESA core that is common to these cards.  The driver supports depths 8, 15
16 and 24.
.SH SUPPORTED HARDWARE
The
.B vesa
driver supports most VESA-compatible video cards.  There are some known
exceptions, and those should be listed here.
.SH CONFIGURATION DETAILS
Please refer to XF86Config(__filemansuffix__) for general configuration
details.  This section only covers configuration details specific to this
driver.

section, and will override the auto-detection:
