@XFree86 on NTO

Status:
Everything builds, and appears to work. Libraries are built as shared.

Building:
Buiding is done as cross-development from QNX4. What you'll need:

QNX4 4.24+
Neutrino 2.0 x86 runtime and development packages for QNX4 host.
Various QNX4 utilities, such as pdksh, cpp etc.

To build:

type (from the xc/ directory)
BOOTSTRAPCFLAGS="-D__QNXNTO__ -Di386 -D__GNUC__" make World 2>&1 | tee make.log

you can also make PPC or MIPS clients (-DPPC or -DMIPS):
BOOTSTRAPCFLAGS="-D__QNXNTO__ -DPPC -D__GNUC__" make World 2>&1 | tee make.log

Let the build run, and then examine make.log for any errors.


Note that we'll very soon be able to build X natively on NTO...
