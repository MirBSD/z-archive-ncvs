<sect>Supported hardware <p>

This driver
supports a single chipset `mediagx' that should work on the following Cyrix
CPUs with integrated graphics:

<itemize>
<item>MediaGX
<item>MediaGXi
<item>MediaGXm
</itemize>

<sect>Features <p>
<itemize>
<item>Rather sparse (color depth hardcoded to 8)
</itemize>

<sect>XF86Config Option <p>
<descrip>
<tag>Option "sw_cursor"</tag>
disable the hardware cursor. (Code not verified yet!)
<tag>Option "no_accel"</tag>
completely disables acceleration. Usually not recommended.
</descrip>

<sect>Bugs and Limitations<p>
<itemize>
<item>As a first cut at the new design, known problems are everywhere.
The console font is corrupted upon exit.  The server seems stable if
the virtual desktop and resolution size match.  I found 1024x768 usable
and that's why I released this version.  Geeks can have fun with this
but NEWBIES should use the 3.3.3.1 release instead!
<item>On some older chipsets, the driver may trigger an illegal instruction
just after probing for the ``scratchpad size''.  If this is the case,
email to <email>hecker@@cat.dfrc.nasa.gov</email> with the output of 
<verb>
XFree86 -probeonly -verbose
</verb>
and this will be fixed.
</itemize>

@Import of XFree86(TM) 4.4.0, the exactly same as was imported
into ocvs under tag XFree86_4_4_0 path src/X-Window, as "X11"
module (for MirOS #8, probably MirOS #7 and maybe OpenBSD).
