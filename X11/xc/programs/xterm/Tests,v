@Tests for xterm:

If system supports window size (i.e., some combination of SIGWINCH,
TIOCSSIZE, TIOCSWINSZ), start a full-screen program (e.g., Emacs,
Jove, vi) and resize the xterm window.  The program must immediately
update its screen image for the new size.

If compiled with -DUTMP, starting a new xterm should create a new utmp
entry.  ("who" will show this info.)  Exiting xterm should remove the
entry.  Killing the xterm window (or other unnatural exit) should also
remove the entry.  When should entries be made in the wtmp file?

Process group stuff should be correct.

Should work without access to /dev/tty, say started from an xdm
started from a boot-time script.

If "xterm -help" offers the -C option, it should work.

echo "test" > /dev/tty

vi with lines that wrap.

Exec'ing things other than shells.

Another thing that has caused problems in the past is process groups,
especially w.r.t. signal propagation to the child.

Popup menu signals: running only a shell, click on "Send INT Signal."
Do you get a new prompt from the shell?  (Same as typing ^C at it.)

Should scroll *fast* with jumpScroll enabled.

While a mouse button is down tracing out a selection, output to the
screen should be suspended.

Selections more than one screen long.

start xterm running only Tek widget: "xterm -t"


Please add to this list if you find xterm failing in some way.
