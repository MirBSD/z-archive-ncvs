.SH NAME

.SH SYNOPSIS

]
.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.I showrgb
program reads an rgb color-name database compiled for use with the dbm
database routines and converts it back to source form, printing the
result to standard output.  The default
database is the one that X was built with, and may be overridden on
the command line.  Specify the database name without
the \fI.pag\fP or \fI.dir\fP suffix.
