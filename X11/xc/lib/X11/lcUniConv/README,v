@$XFree86: xc/lib/X11/lcUniConv/README,v 1.3 2003/10/24 15:34:01 tsi Exp $

The files in this directory are taken from the libiconv-1.1 package.

The *.h files were generated from tables (mostly from ftp.unicode.org) using
the programs '8bit_tab_to_h.c' and 'cjk_tab_to_h.c'. On some of them, further
optimizations were applied by hand.

If you find a bug in these files, instead of modifying them in XFree86
and let it diverge from libiconv, please notify the libiconv maintainer
(currently <bruno@@clisp.org>) so he can fix both in synch.
