/* XDisplayName.c */
/* 
 * Returns the name of the display XOpenDisplay would use.  This is better
 * than just printing the "display" variable in a program because that
 * could be NULL and/or there could be an environment variable set.
 * This makes it easier for programmers to provide meaningful error
 * messages. 
 *
 * 
 * For example, this is used in XOpenDisplay() as
 *	strncpy( displaybuf, XDisplayName( display ), sizeof(displaybuf) );
 *      if ( *displaybuf == '\0' ) return( NULL );
 *  This check is actually unnecessary because the next thing is an index()
 *  call looking for a ':' which will fail and we'll return(NULL).
