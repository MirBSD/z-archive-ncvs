/* For shared texture space managment, these texture objects may also

 * proxy textures) are subject to the same LRU aging we use for our

@Import of XFree86(TM) 4.4.0, the exactly same as was imported
into ocvs under tag XFree86_4_4_0 path src/X-Window, as "X11"
module (for MirOS #8, probably MirOS #7 and maybe OpenBSD).
