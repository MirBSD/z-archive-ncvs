@[PLEASE make your Subject: line as descriptive as possible.
Subjects like "xterm bug" or "bug report" are not helpful!]
[Remove all the explanatory text in brackets before mailing.]
[Send to xbugs@@x.org, as shown in the sample message 
header below]

[NOTE: This form is intended for reporting bugs to X.Org about X.Org releases.
If you're reporting an XFree86-specific bug, please use the BugReport form
in xc/programs/Xserver/hw/xfree86/doc/ and send it to xfree86@@xfree86.org.]

To: xbugs@@x.org
Subject: [area]: [synopsis]   [replace with actual area and short description]

     VERSION:

R6.6

     CLIENT MACHINE and OPERATING SYSTEM:

[e.g. Sparc/SunOS 5.6, S.u.S.E. Linux 5.0 kernel 2.0.30, etc.]

     DISPLAY TYPE:

[e.g. Xsun, Xhp, Xdec, XF86_*, /usr/openwin/bin/Xsun, etc. ]

     WINDOW MANAGER:

[e.g. twm, mwm, fvwm95, enlightenment, etc.]

     COMPILER:

[e.g. native ANSI cc, native cc, ecgs 1.0, etc.]

     AREA:

[Area of the source tree affected,
e.g., Xserver, Xlib, Xt, Xaw, PEX, twm, xterm, xmh, config, ....
Please only one area per bug report.]

     SYNOPSIS:

[Brief description of the problem and where it is located]

     DESCRIPTION:

[Detailed description of problem.  Don't presume that the bug
is self evident. If possible cite specification references (X,
ANSI/POSIX/ISO, X/Open, etc.) to support why it is a bug. For
program crashes a little bit of analysis about why a NULL pointer
was dereferenced or why a buffer overflowed goes a long way.
If this is a request for an enhancement, justify it.]

     REPEAT BY:

[What you did to get the error; include test program or session
transcript if at all possible. Be specific -- if we can't reproduce 
it, we can't fix it.  Don't just say "run this program and it will 
be obvious," tell us exactly what we should see when the program 
is run. Bug reports without a clear, deterministic way of reproducing 
them will be fixed only after all bug reports that do.]

     SAMPLE FIX:

[Please send context diffs (`diff -c original-file fixed-file`).  
Be sure to include the "XConsortium" or "TOG" ident line in any 
diffs -- the best way to do this is to add your own versioning 
line immediately after ours.]
