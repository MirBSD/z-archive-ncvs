@Rules for Open GL man pages:

    *	Describe commands that differ only by a suffix on the same
	page.  Do this regardless of whether the commands take the
	same or different arguments.  For example, all 24 Vertex
	commands are described on one page.

	Issue - current tools like to separate v and non-v commands.

    *	Describe commands that operate in obvious pairs on the same
	page.  For example, Begin and End, or PushMatrix and PopMatrix.

    *	Use the _header(desc) macro to begin a manpage.  Write the
	1-line command description "desc" using the imperative tense.
	For example:

		_header(Operate on the accumulation buffer)
		
	not
		_header(Operates on the accumulation buffer)

    *	The order of the entries on a manpage is

		header
		PARAMETERS (unless the command takes no parameters)
		DESCRIPTION
		EXAMPLE (optional)
		ERRORS (optional)
		SEE ALSO
		BUGS (optional)
		NOTES (optional)

    *	Use the _phead(param) macro to describe each parameter or
	group of parameters.

    *	Begin the description of in-only parameters with the phrase
	"Specifies".

    *	Begin the description of out-only parameters with the phrase
	"Returns".

    *	Begin the description of in-and-out parameters with the
	phrase "Specifies and returns".  If there is a difference
	between what is specified and what is returned, use two
	paragraphs for the description, the first beginning with
	"Specifies" and the second beginning with "Returns".

    *	Group like parameters into a single description.  For example
	"x,y  Specify the x and y coordinates ...", or
	"r,g,b  Return the red, green, and blue color values ..."

	Possible tools issue.

    *	Include the default value in the description of parameters
	that directly specify GL state.

    *	Refer to parameters using the _param# macro, never explicitly
	by name.  Note that this rules out clever English tricks that
	count on the macro evaluating to a particular string.  For
	example, one cannot say "The second parameter is a floating
	point _param2", where it is expected that _param2 will evaluate
	to the string "value".

    *	Use _cmnd to refer to the command being described.

    *	Use _cmnd(basename) to refer to another command.  Note that
	basename does not include any prefix, it is added automatically
	by the _cmnd() macro.

    *	Use _const(basename) to refer to a constant.  Note that
	basename does not include any prefix, it is added automatically
	by the _const() macro.

    *	Use _hex(value) to refer to a hexidecimal value.
	(This should not be required very often in the Open GL.)

    *	List commands in the see also section in alphabetical order.
	Include commands that return all the state that is set by
	the command being documented.

Limitations of the alpha release:

    *	The header, command syntax, parameter descriptions, and see
	also sections will be complete.

    *	The command description may not be complete, but it will at
	least exist.

    *	The example section may not exist.

@Import of XFree86(TM) 4.4.0, the exactly same as was imported
into ocvs under tag XFree86_4_4_0 path src/X-Window, as "X11"
