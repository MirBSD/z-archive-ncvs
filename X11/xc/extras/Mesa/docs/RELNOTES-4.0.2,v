                          Mesa 4.0.2 release notes

                             March 25, 2002

                              PLEASE READ!!!!



Introduction
------------

Mesa uses an even/odd version number scheme like the Linux kernel.
Odd numbered versions (such as 3.3) designate new developmental releases.
Even numbered versions (such as 3.4) designate stable releases.

Mesa 4.0.2 only contains bug fixes and a new DOS driver since version 4.0.1.

See the docs/VERSIONS file for the list of bug fixes.


Device Drivers
--------------

Mesa advertises itself as either OpenGL 1.2 or OpenGL 1.3 depending on the
device driver.  If the driver enables all the ARB extensions which are part
of OpenGL 1.3 then glGetString(GL_VERSION) will return "1.3".  Otherwise,
it'll return "1.2".

A number of Mesa's software drivers haven't been actively maintained for
some time.  We rely on volunteers to maintain many of the drivers.
Here's the current status of all included drivers:

Driver			Status
----------------------	---------------------
XMesa (Xlib)		implements OpenGL 1.3
OSMesa (off-screen)	implements OpenGL 1.3
FX (3dfx Voodoo1/2)	implements OpenGL 1.3
SVGA			implements OpenGL 1.3
Wind River UGL		implements OpenGL 1.3
Windows/Win32		implements OpenGL 1.3
DOS/DJGPP		implements OpenGL 1.3 (new in Mesa 4.0.2)
GGI			needs updating
BeOS			needs updating
Allegro			needs updating
D3D			needs updating

@Import of XFree86(TM) 4.4.0, the exactly same as was imported
into ocvs under tag XFree86_4_4_0 path src/X-Window, as "X11"
