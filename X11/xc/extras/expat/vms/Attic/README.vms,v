@4-jun-2002	Craig A. Berry
		Added rudimentary build procedures for 
		OpenVMS based on work by Martin Vorlaender.


You'll need MMS or its freeware equivalent MMK.  Just go to the 
top-level directory and type

$ MMS/DESCRIPTION=[.vms]
 
  or

$ MMK/DESCRIPTION=[.vms]

You'll end up with the object library expat.olb.  For now, installation
consists merely of copying the object library, include files, and
documentation to a suitable location.  

To-do list:

	-- create a shareable image
	-- build and run the tests and build the xmlwf utility
	-- create an install target

@Import of XFree86(TM) 4.4.0, the exactly same as was imported
into ocvs under tag XFree86_4_4_0 path src/X-Window, as "X11"
module (for MirOS #8, probably MirOS #7 and maybe OpenBSD).
