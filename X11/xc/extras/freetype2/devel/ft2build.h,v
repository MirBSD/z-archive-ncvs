  *  this is a development version of <ft2build.h> that is used

  *  which contains different settings for all configuration macros
  *
  *  to use it, you must define the environment variable FT2_BUILD_INCLUDE
  *  to point to the directory containing these two files ("ft2build.h" and
  *  "ftoption.h"), then invoke Jam as usual
