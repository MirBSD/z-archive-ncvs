@Note that the list of known bugs for FreeType 2 is now located in the
document "docs/BUGS".

Here is a list of items that need to be addressed in FreeType 2; they are
not exactly bugs, but should be considered though:

* Implement stem3/counter hints properly in the Postscript hinter.

* FInalize the cache sub-system. If has been in beta for too long :-)

* The automatic and Postscript hinters have been improved to increase
  the quality of AA text, but Monochrome and LCD hinting still suck. we
  need to do something about that..
