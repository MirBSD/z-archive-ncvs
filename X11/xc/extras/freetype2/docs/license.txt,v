   The FreeType   2 font   engine  is   copyrighted work,   and cannot   be
   used  legally  without a   software license.   In order   to make   this
   project  usable  to  a  vast majority  of developers,  we distribute  it
   under two dual licenses.

   What this  means is  that *you*  must choose  *one* license among  those
   described below,  then obey  all  its  terms and  conditions when  using
   FreeType 2 in any of your projects or products:


     - The  FreeType License,  found in  the file  "FTL.TXT", which  is
       an     BSD-style  open-source   license *with*  an   advertising
       clause   that      forces   you   to   explicitely   cite    the
       FreeType   project   in  your      product's  documentation. All
       details are in the license file


     - The GNU General Public   License, found in "GPL.TXT",  which  is
       the      traditionnal   and    "viral"   GPL    license,    that
       forces  you   to     redistribute the _complete_ sources of  all
       your products that simply     use FreeType 2.


   Note that  the contributed  PCF driver  comes with  a license similar to
   that  of   X Window   System  which  is  compatible   to the  above  two
   licenses (see file src/pcf/readme).

@Import of XFree86(TM) 4.4.0, the exactly same as was imported
