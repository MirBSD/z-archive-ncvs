@How to build the freetype2 library on VMS
-----------------------------------------

Just type one of the following depending on the type of external entries you
want:

  mms

or

  mms/macro=("COMP_FLAGS=/name=(as_is,short)")

The library is avalaible in the directory

  [.LIB]

To compile applications using freetype2 you'll need to define the logical
FREETYPE pointing to the directory

  [.INCLUDE.FREETYPE]

(i.e., if the directory in which this README.VMS file is located is
$disk:[freetype] then define the logical with

  define freetype $disk:[freetype.include.freetype]

This version has been tested with Compaq C V6.2-006 on OpenVMS Alpha V7.2-1.
