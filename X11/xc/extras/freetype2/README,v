  Special notes to Unix users
  ===========================

  Please   read  the  file   "docs/UPGRADE.UNX",  it   contains  important
  information  regarding  the  installation  of  FreeType on Unix systems,
  especially GNU based operating systems like GNU/Linux.

  FreeType 2's library is called `libfreetype', FreeType 1's library
  is called `libttf'.  They are *not* compatible!


  FreeType 2.1.4
  ==============

  Please   read  the  docs/CHANGES   file,  it   contains  IMPORTANT
  INFORMATION.

  Read  the  files "docs/INSTALL"  for installation instructions.

  Note  that the  FreeType 2  documentation  is now  available as  a
  separate package from our sites.  See:

    ftp://ftp.freetype.org/pub/freetype2/ftdocs-2.1.4.tar.bz2
    ftp://ftp.freetype.org/pub/freetype2/ftdocs-2.1.4.tar.gz
    ftp://ftp.freetype.org/pub/freetype2/ftdoc214.zip


  Reports
  =======

  Please  report  bugs  by  e-mail to  `devel@@freetype.org'.   Don't
  forget to send  a detailed explanation of the  problem -- there is
  nothing worse  than receiving a  terse message that only  says "it
  doesn't work".



  Enjoy!
