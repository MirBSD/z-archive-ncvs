@The XPM library for Amiga works best with AmigaOS 3.x, but will work
(with limited color support) with earlier OS versions too. It can be
compiled with both SAS/C and GCC (makefiles are included).

All functions except the Xpm*Pixmap* functions are supported.

I have also written some Amiga-specific utility functions (not
included). Contact me if you would like to have them too.

@Import of XFree86(TM) 4.4.0, the exactly same as was imported
into ocvs under tag XFree86_4_4_0 path src/X-Window, as "X11"
module (for MirOS #8, probably MirOS #7 and maybe OpenBSD).
