@VDESK EXTERNAL PAGER

vdesk is a small standalone application for providing virtual desktop
support to window managers that do not support it themselves.  evilwm
*does* have inbuilt virtual desktops, but if you want to support vdesk you
can set a compile-time option to do so - read the Makefile for details.

vdesk was written by Adam Sampson <azz@@gnu.org> and is available from his
web site:  http://azz.us-lot.org/code.html
