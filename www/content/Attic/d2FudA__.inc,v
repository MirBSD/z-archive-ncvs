<h1>Hardware wishlist</h1>

<p>Alphabetically sorted by developers; short-term first,
 long-term wishes last. Food, beer, travel tickets welcome.</p>

<h3>tg@@</h3><ul>
<li>A 4-9 GB SCSI hard disc for my SPARCstation 20</li>
<li>A Pentium-233 MMX Socket 7 CPU</li>
<li>A passively cooled Baby-AT (not ATX/ITX/BTX) power
 supply unit for use with low-power desktops (P-233)</li>
<li>A supported USB 2 adapter as PCMCIA card</li>
<li>A large 2.5" IDE laptop hard disc (slow discs (4500 U/min)
 preferred over fast (5400 or 7200 U/min) discs for better
 reliability and less heat)</li>
<li>A WLAN adapter for a <a href="http://www.soekris.com/net4801.htm">Soekris
 net4801</a> (PCI), or an external not manageable Ethernet 802.3 to
 WLAN 802.11b bridge (no router please)</li>
<li>A Crypto-Card for a <a href="http://www.soekris.com/net4801.htm">Soekris
 net4801</a> (Mini-PCI, AES)</li>
<li>A memory expansion for an Acer Aspire 1300 laptop</li>
<li>An external CD burning device, for use at exhibitions (the one
 built into my laptop is old and gets hot pretty fast)</li>
<li>An adapter for using a PS/2 keyboard on USB</li>
<li>A good (really, I mean it) USB<->serial converter</li>
<li>Upgrades of any kind for a SPARCstation 20 (such as a CPU
 faster than the 75 MHz one, more RAM, more HDD, good NIC)</li>
<li>A working i386 system (about K6-III/500, 512 MiB RAM, 40 GB HDD)
 for testing snapshots, and MirPorts/OpenBSD</li>
<li>Not before mid-/end of 2005: An amd64 board with an
 Opteron 140 or similar, and 1 to 2 ISA expansion slots (preferably
 with chassis, PSU, memory)</li>
</ul>

@Since I've got to import something now to test the ^E#(&^ perl script,
transfer a checkout of the website to ncvs now.
