<h1>MirBSD &nbsp; MirLinux &nbsp; MirPorts &nbsp; &mdash; &nbsp; Main Page</h1>
<h3>Software Patent Issues</h3>
<p>The <tt>MirOS Project</tt> would like to join the hundreds of thousands of
 parties protesting against software, algorithm and even data structure
 patentability in the European Union!</p>
<p>Call for action: sign the FFII petition, write your local MEP!</p>
<p class="erecta">More information at <a href="http://swpat.ffii.org/">FFII
 website</a>.</p>
<h2>Welcome to the MirOS Project!</h2>
<p>This project is driven by a small number of people, that's why this
 website isn't always up to date. It's optimized for lynx and works in
 Konqueror; IE and Mozilla&trade;-crap do have problems with it.<br />New:
 <a href="/?style">the Stylesheet selector</a> to improve readability.</p>
<p><big>Where to go next?</big><br />If you want to read about what MirOS
 actually <b>is</b>, visit the &quot;about&quot; href (hyperlink) on the
 left side. &quot;get MirOS!&quot; should be self-explanatory, and files
 are available as well as a full ISO image!</p>
<p><big>We're looking</big> for people wanting to ensure quality of MirPorts
 under MirOS BSD and OpenBSD. If you're interested and have &gt;1
 year of experience with the OpenBSD Ports Tree, and are not scared of
 &lt;bsd.port.mk&gt;; please contact us. We also <big>need web site
 hackers</big> who keep track of source changes.</p>
<h3>News</h3>
<p>The <a href="/stuff/oreilly-bsdss-flyer.pdf">Flyer</a> for the O'Reilly
 <a href="/stuff/oreilly-bsdss.pdf">&quot;BSD Success Stories&quot;</a>
 is available for download.</p>
<p>Attention: All announcements from the MirOS team are <a
 href="/cvs.cgi/contrib/samples/devel-keys">cryptographically
 signed using PGP or OpenSSL</a> in order to prevent abuse of our name.</p>
<p>Go to <a href="/?news">the main news page</a>.</p>
<h3 style="color:red;">Latest Release</h3>

 There will be two sets of T-Shirts for sale at 21C3, Berlin, Germany.</p>
<p>PORTS: June 15th, 2004: MirPorts flag day; please read the page on <a

 using MirPorts. More detailed instructions will arrive at the page above.</p>
<p>STABLE: June 14th, 2004: <a href="/?ann-7">MirOS #7quater</a> is available
 for retrieval. Click the &quot;get MirOS!&quot; link on the left for further
 information - where you can buy CDs or download the ISO.</p>
<p>CVSROOT: November 23th, 2004: new seed file (316 MB) available to reduce
 the initial amount of traffic required for mirroring /ocvs by rsync. CTM is
 available on request, we'd like to do it but nobody uses it.<br />Attention:
 the CVSROOT of MirOS is no longer <tt>/cvs</tt> but rather <b><tt>/ocvs</tt>
 </b> and <tt>/cvs</tt> compat links will be removed the end of the month.</p>
<h2>Big Warning</h2>
<p>Do not go to &quot;mirbsd.org&quot; - it's not a domain of ours and
 used to transfer you to a faecal website.</p>
