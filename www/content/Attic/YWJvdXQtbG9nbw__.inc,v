<h1>The MirOS, Linux, BSD Logos</h1>
<h3 id="miroslogo">The new MirOS logo</h3>
<p>We are discussing about a new logo (a Schabrackentapir with a d&aelig;mon
 sitting on it, having a penguin picked up with his fork ;-), but in our
 opinion, having functional code is more important than a lousy website.</p>
<h3 id="cutedaemon">The BSD d&aelig;mon</h3>

<p>The BSD d&aelig;mon picture is Copyright &copy; 1988 by Marshall Kirk

 their personal use within the bounds of good taste. When reasonably
 possible, this text is to be included.<br />If you want to mass produce
 the d&aelig;mon, for example on CDROM or T-Shirts, you need permission in
 advance. Permission to use it may be obtained from: <a

 with MirOS httpd 3.30A from the base system and have popped up first in
 NCSA Mosaic; they are public domain. The &quot;systemagic&quot; blowfish
 comes from the OpenBSD people.</p>

 is not.</p>
