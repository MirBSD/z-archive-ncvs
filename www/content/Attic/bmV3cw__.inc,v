<h1>Current MirOS News</h1><ul>

<li>03.12.2004<br />
	CVS 1.12.10 has entered HEAD and replaces CVS 1.11.1p1 which has
	done well for ages. (Let me repeat it again: do not try to access
	a new repository with an old cvs binary or vice versa.)<br />Some
	time_t related bugs have been fixed; compat_openbsd(8) has been
	extended to the point that it successfully runs Mozilla&trade;
	Firefox&trade; and probably also Sun's native Java&trade;.</li>

<li>30.11.2004<br />
	The <a href="/?clog-2004#snap1129">new snapshot</a> is up via the
	<a href="http://f.scarywater.net/miros/">BitTorrent tracker</a>.
	Today you will get excellent download rates, tomorrow we will have
	to reduce the upstream for cost reasons. It will appear on direct
	download mirrors later. Please test test test, we haven't been able
	to do so before. Time handling looks fixed now, OpenBSD emulation
	is pretty damn stable. [UPDATE] Everything which uses rusage()
	under emulatin (Linux or OpenBSD) is still broken.</li>

<li>24.11.2004<br />
	No new snapshot yet. Problems with time handling, both in our libc
	routines (by Ohlson, DJB and me) and in format string handlings
	(such as these in libcrypto of OpenSSL fame) have further delayed
	proliferation of a &quot;known good&quot; snapshot (ie. X.509 cert
	validation broke, so I couldn't use pine or lynx).<br />Let me
	repeat: It is <strong>important</strong> that, once the new snap
	is out, you all test it. I mean it.</li>

<li>21.11.2004<br />
	A <a href="/?clog-2004#snap1121">new snapshot</a> has been released
	via <a href="http://f.scarywater.net/miros/">BitTorrent</a> and <a
	href="/?getting">direct download</a>. New features: fixed Linux and
	newly written OpenBSD 3.6-current emulation; lots of bug fixes. This
	snapshot is a &quot;known good&quot; state of MirOS #8-beta; we will
	start porting cvs-1.12 and gcc-3.4 now that this snapshot is released.
	See you at <a href="http://www.ccc.de/congress/2004/">21C3</a>!<br />
	Update: the snapshot is <strong>revoked</strong> for both bugs in the
	installer/ramdisk and <strong>corrupt</strong> time handling!</li>

@Since I've got to import something now to test the ^E#(&^ perl script,
transfer a checkout of the website to ncvs now.
