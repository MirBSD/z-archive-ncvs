<p class="admin">ATTN: Candidate for moving into MirWiki!</p>
<h1>Caveats</h1>
<!-- deleteme --><h2>Need People</h2>
<p>We're in need of people who keep the website, especially this
 page, up to date. Please contact the MirOS team by eMail.</p>
<h2>Content</h2><!-- endof deleteme --><ul>
<li><a href="/?ports">MirPorts</a> have changed, read on for more.</li>
<li>You cannot access a cvs 1.11 repository with 1.12 and vice
 versa. cvs 1.12 refuses to do so, but cvs 1.11 is unsafe.</li>
<li>MirOS-current is <strong>not binary compatible</strong> with
 older binaries. An OpenBSD emulation will be provided later.</li>
<li>SSH root logins, SSHv1 and SSHv2-DSA are disabled by default
 in the current version of MirOS.</li>
<li>FTP (if enabled by admin) allows only S/Key, no plain text
 passwords, by default (login.conf).</li>
<li>SPARC /etc/syslog.conf has an error in MirOS BSD #7ter. Remove the
 line containing <tt>ttyC4</tt> with the editor. This is fixed in the
 current version.</li>
<li>When moving the disklabel partition into an extended partition,
 you must take care of loading the first-stage boot loader (pbr_ffs)
 yourself - for example by chaining into it from NTLDR.</li>
<li>This website is out of date with respect to -current.</li>
<li>A possible hole in OpenIPF state-keeping (discovered by <a
 href="http://archives.neohapsis.com/archives/fulldisclosure/2004-01/0059.html">Darren
 Reed</a>)<br />Summary: States are created on one interface by a rule,
 but matched on any interface. Use <tt>(if-bound)</tt> in -current. Avoid
 using <tt>keep/modulate state</tt> in #7 and older.</li>
<li><tt>ed(1)</tt> is the standard EDITOR...</li>
<li>Users in the wheel group can su to root by default, that's why they
 can sudo to root now, too.</li>
<li>Default routes are <em>not</em> preserved when set in the installer,
 and must be set in <a href="/man5/hostname.if.htm">hostname.if(5)</a>,
 not <tt>/etc/mygate</tt> which is ignored.</li>
<li>-current users: you should really read the ChangeLog files, or the
 CVS mails. There is a lot of changes.</li>
</ul>
<h1>Features of MirOS BSD</h1>
<p>This is a more or less complete list of selected differences between
 OpenBSD 3.4-current and MirOS BSD current:</p><ul>
<li>Improvements in the CVS infrastructure.</li>
<li>Slim base system: documentation and programmes that are considered
 not basic, or bloated, unnecessary or have a licence considered not free
 enough, have been removed or moved to the MirPorts framework to be
 installed later. Among these are: Kerberos IV, Kerberos V, NIS/YP, BIND 9,
 AFS/Arla, AMD, NLS/Locale/I18N; the C++, Fortran and Objective-C compilers
 of the GNU C Compiler suite 2.95.3 and everything that was licensed under
 the GNU Free Documentation License which declared front or back cover texts
 or invariant sections. Easy shortcuts have been added for people who want to
 rebuild their base system with SENDMAIL SASL or without sendmail, apache, the
 documentation, games, perl, ...</li>
<li>Several GNU utilities have been replaced by their BSD UNIX&reg;
 counterparts from AT&amp;T UNIX&reg; up to 32V, which was released by Caldera
 International, Inc. (now known as The SCO group) in 1999 under a four-clause
 UCB-style open source certified licence, in order to enable the customer to
 do with MirOS what he wants. Among these are: Groff, BC/DC, GZip, Diff.</li>
<li>Unused files (documentary, ChangeLogs, VMS and Win32 code) has been
 removed to speed up retrieving and updating the source tree.</li>
<li>Except for the compiler for the C Language, gcc 2.95 has been removed
 from the base system. The C compiler is installed as <tt>pgcc(1)</tt>
 fall-back compiler only. The entire base system has been made
 compilable using the fallback compiler only. No C++ code is left.
 Deprecated functions (such as strcpy() and bzero()) have been nuked from
 being used in most of the codebase.</li>
<li>The system compiler is now GCC 3.2.3 with the Propolice stack protector
 enabled, which yields a huge security improvement about stock systems.</li>
<li>Since MirOS currently targets machines with an 80486DX CPU and more than
 32 MiB RAM only, and in the future will run on Pentium-class machines only.
 The sparc version has been tested on two SPARCstation 20.
 The XFree86 3.3.6 subsystem, the X11R5 and any non-i386 code have been
 removed from the tree as a consequence.</li>
<li>This eliminates potential bug sources in the base system and improves
 system stability as well as performance.</li>
<li>The Apache web server has been updated to the latest 1.3 release and
 comes with integrated support for the IPv6 Internet Protocol.</li>
<li>GNU libiberty has been updated to latest code from GCC 3.3.1 and GNU
 binutils 2.14. The GNU binutils used in-tree have been updated to 2.14.</li>
<li>The popular X11 Window Manager <tt>evilwm(1)</tt> has been updated to
 the latest version and enhanced. It is installed by default, although the
 OpenBSD <tt>fvwm(1)</tt> environment is still enabled bt default.</li>
<li>The licence for distributing the BSD d&aelig;mon and the Linux penguin
 has been obtained, so these pictures were not removed from XFree86.</li>
<li>The popular web browser <tt>lynx(1)</tt> has been updated to the latest
 development snapshot and fixed; some fixes and enhancements have been
 submitted upstream and even integrated.</li>
<li>All of the in-tree GNU software has common scripts such as a top-level
 master configure, install-sh, mkinstalldirs (from BSD) and friends moved to
 ${GNUSYSTEM_AUX_DIR} at a central place in the tree.</li>
<li>The i386 MBR (master boot record) and PBR (first-stage boot loader / partition
 boot record) code has been rewritten from scratch using the GNU assembler's
 new <tt>intel_syntax,noprefix</tt> mode. Thus it documents said mode now,
 because the GNU documentation is inaccurate and partially wrong.</li>
<li>The i386 boot code (MBR, PBR, /boot) has been extended by support for LBA and
 single-sector CHS access mode, thus supporting drives larger than 8 Gigabyte
 as well as Soekris systems and other computers with an old or broken BIOS.</li>
<li>The i386 MBR code has an optional (enabled by default) boot manager integrated
 which facilitates booting the default partition, a chosen primary partition
 on the first hard disc, or chaining to the first floppy drive. After a
 time-out of 10 seconds it boots the default partition.<br />The
 non-bootmanager MBR code can be installed by executing:<pre>

		# fdisk -ef /nonexistent wd0
		fdisk: 1&gt; u
		fdisk: 1&gt; w
		fdisk: 1&gt; q
 </pre></li>
<li>Totally rewritten initialization code of the second-stage boot loader,
 <tt>/usr/mdec/boot</tt>, allowing to use it as the boot image of an
 &quot;El Torito&quot; bootable CD-ROM in &quot;No Emulation&quot; mode
 despite it being an ELF executable loadable by the classic PBR.<br />
 The new boot code is also capable of loading nearly any kernel directly
 from an ISO9660 filesystem (i.e. CD-ROM device) using the El Torito BIOS
 interface.<br /><!-- XXX -->In the future, it will also be capable of
 chaining the boot to floppy images provided on the disc.</li>
<li>The new boot code is also directly executable as an MS-DOS .com file.
 It also handles moving the disklabel partition (type 0x27) into an
 extended partition.</li>
<li>Integrated bootstrap ability over the network using our unique
 sysutils/pxegrub port, based upon work done by Cedric Berger. This is a
 hacked variant of GNU Grub, which can load the usual suspectives of
 kernels (Linux, GNU HURD) from any medium known to work before, as well
 as load MirBSD kernels via the network using DHCP and TFTP. The GRUB itself
 can be loaded via PXE or Etherboot, or from a floppy disc.</li>
<li>Network-bootable bsd.rd.net kernel for SPARC, eliminating the need for
 more than a RARP and TFTP d&aelig;mon on the source side.</li>
<li>Support for nearly everything the GENERIC kernel supports on the CD-ROM
 (bsd.rd) installation kernel to facilitate using it as a chroot(2) rescue
 and emergency system.</li>
<li>Installation support using FAT, ext2, ext3, UFS1 ffs, NTFS, HTTP, FTP,
 NFS as source medium. Support for PPP with kernel-mode pppd(8) on the 1440Ki
 floppy, and PPP with user-mode ppp(8) supporting ISDN SyncPPP and HDLC,
 PPP, PPPoE, PPPoA on the 2880Ki floppy/CD-ROM. Integrated support for setting
 up a RAID root system and installing to it.</li>
<li>Own set of boot floppies, kernel structured like GENERIC.</li>
<li>Support for disabling <tt>fsck(8)</tt> for ffs filesystems with softdep
 enabled (default in the MirBSD installer) in <tt>/etc/fstab</tt>.
 Includes automatic sorting of the fstab file implemented in korn shell.</li>
<li>Regular synchronization of the base system and MirPorts with OpenBSD.</li>
<li>Highly improved set of shell script infrastructure using security
 features of the Korn shell, which is <tt>/bin/sh</tt> in MirOS. Automatic
 discovery of IDE hard disc drives which need their write cache disabled.</li>
<li>Import of enhancements from NetBSD, FreeBSD and MicroBSD:</li>
<li>Improvements for the ELF executable format from NetBSD, leading to
 support for recent Wine (MS Windows&reg;) emulators.</li>
<li>Full ISDN BRI (64k*2) and PRI (T1-1536kbps and E1-2048kbps) support
 (no PRI/PMX device drivers yet) and isdnd(8) userland tool from NetBSD,
 but with unsafe string functions such as sprintf(3) removed and replaced
 by their safe counterparts (snprintf(3), strlcpy/strlcat(3)).</li>
<li>Privacy improvements: root can forbid "ps a" and "ps e" (show all users
 the processes of all users, or the environment attached to a process)</li>
<li>Allow mknod() to succeed within a chroot() unless disabled in the kernel
 configuration. This allows much cleaner release builds.</li>
<li>The <tt>CTM</tt> package, growfs(8) and ffsinfo(8), as well as some
 minor files from FreeBSD.</li>
<li>Improved wtf(1) originated from NetBSD wtf(6) with a huge acronyme
 database in two languages.</li>
<li>Always initialize variables in the kernel to 0 (from MicroBSD).</li>
<li>Integrated tinyirc and ssfe programmes (GNU) and dict (NPL) in the
 base system, facilitating easy support in the Freenode or OFTC IRC network.
 Replaced unsafe string functions in these with safe counterparts.</li>
<li><tt>host(1)</tt> including a nslookup fallback compatibility script
 from the audited (prior) OpenBSD BIND4 versions.</li>
<li>hd(1) as variant of hexdump(1) with MS-DOS-alike display.</li>
<li>Lynx SSL improvements; install a bunch of well-known X509v3 Root CA
 certificates for lynx and sendmail by default.</li>
<li>sendmail comes with STARTTLS up and running by default using a snake-oil
 certificate, suggested by Thorsten Glaser and discussed with members of the
 Chaos Computer Club and Trash.net. Read starttls(8) to find out more!</li>
<li>DRI support in the X-Window subsystem. No DRM yet, though.</li>
<li>Supplied sample files: <a href="http://www.ifross.de/">ifrOSS</a> approved
 licence template to be used for newly written code in MirOS. Sample X-Window
 environment and OpenSSL CA configuration files.</li>
<li>Much enhanced COPYRIGHT file, including a summary of all advertising
 clauses that have existed in the project tree. ASCII-Art of MirOS related
 pictures. Acknowledgement to use the BSD d&aelig;mon for the project from
 Marshall Kirk McKusick. Install GNU licenses by default, too.</li>
<li>Infrastructure for supporting more than one underlying kernel/libc
 (base OS) combination, which will eventually lead to MirLinux.</li>
<li>Manpage fixes and enhancements, date display fixed and unified between
 tmac.an.old and tmac.mdoc; Makefile enhancements (make foo.E generates a
 preprocessed source file); what is now MirOS/MirPorts and started as
 OpenBSD-current-mirabile is more than one year old! - Updated papers, USD,
 PSD and SMM documentation from 4.4BSD-Alpha under the Caldera license.</li>
<li>Configuration files change: A lot of &quot;dotfiles&quot; such as
 <tt>~/.ssh</tt> have been moved (for example to <tt>~/.etc/ssh</tt>).
 More &quot;local&quot; files are supported (for example /etc/mk.conf.local,
 /etc/profile.local, /etc/changelist.local). More files are installed and
 enabled by default (for example /etc/profile, ~/.etc/ssh/known_hosts,
 /etc/mk.conf). Porters are suggested to fix their ports to obey to the
 <tt>~/.etc/</tt> structure, too.</li>
<li>Ports tree (MirPorts subsystem) enhancements:</li>
<li>&quot;Plug-In&quot; support for <tt>gcc 3.2.3</tt> in /etc/mk.conf for
 compiling software using the MirPorts framework.
 Plans for using gcc 3.x as system compiler already exist.</li>
<li>New or enhanced ports, for example: djbdns (IPv6, VeriSign, fixes);
 Wine/WineX/XoverOffice/ReWind; CUPS; Pine; sIRC; PGP 2.6.3in; RealPlayer;
 mPlayer; DJB daemontools; Midnight Commander; CenterICQ; p5-Socket6 (for
 IPv6 sockets in perl), JOE's Own Editor v2.8, the SixXS public beta IPv6
 tunnel heartbeat client, a <strong>working K Desktop Environment, version
 3.1.1</strong> and <strong>the GNU GNOME desktop suite and developer's
 framework, version 2.4</strong>.</li>
<li>Unused, broken or old ports have been removed. There is a total of
 <strong>2529 ports available</strong> through the MirPorts framework,
 several more than under OpenBSD 3.4, but not all could have been tested.</li>
<li>Some ports removed from OpenBSD for (to me apparently) political or broken-ness reasons
 have been resurrected: ucspi-tcp, sunjdk-1.1, flashplugin for example.</li>
<li>A whole lot of minor optimizations and cleanup</li>
<li>Support and development via IRC and Usenet, not through ancient ICB.</li>
<li>And no remote holes in the default maintainer in ONE year! ;-)</li>
</ul>
