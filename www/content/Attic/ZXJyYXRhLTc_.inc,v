<h1>Errata for #7-stable</h1>
<!-- deleteme --><h2>Need People</h2>
<p>We're in need of people who keep the website, especially this
 page, up to date. Please contact the MirOS team by eMail.</p>
<h2>Content</h2><!-- endof deleteme -->
<p>This page attempts to identify known issues for users of the MirOS
 #7 installation, documenting why they should update to the latest
 stable branch (CVS Tag: MIRBSD_7).</p>
<h1>Corrigenda</h1><ul>
<li><strong style="color:#FF0000;">This list is not up to date!</strong></li>
<li>An <a href="/MirOS/v7.4/updates/20041027.tar.gz">update for #7quater</a>
 compiled by bsiegert@@</li>
<li>Multiple vulnerabilities in Apache&trade;'s mod_ssl and cvs.<br />
 Fix: Upgrade <tt>src/gnu/usr.bin/cvs</tt> and
 <tt>src/gnu/usr.sbin/httpd</tt> from CVS and recompile both Apache&trade; and CVS.
 <a href="http://benz.mine.nu/MirBSD/updates/7quater/20040627-cvs-httpd.tar.gz">A
 binary upgrade</a> is also available. Be sure to check the
 <a href="http://benz.mine.nu/MirBSD/updates/7quater/20040627-cvs-httpd.tar.gz.sig">signature</a>.</li>
<li class="erecta">MirOS #7quater released.</li>
<li>Numerous backports from OpenBSD missing.<br />
 Fix: update to MirOS #7quater.</li>
<li>MirOS #7ter did not run on certain SPARCstation models (SS5, namely).<br />
 Fix: update <tt>/etc/mk.conf</tt> to match the -stable version
 and recompile on a supported SPARC, or install MirOS #7quater.</li>
<li>MirPorts-current need newer package tools.<br />
 Fix: update to latest -stable and recompile src/usr.sbin/pkg_install,
 or install MirOS #7quater.</li>
<li>Numerous fixes and backports from OpenBSD, as well as some on
 our own. We'll shortly identify the issues.</li>
<li class="erecta">MirOS #7ter released.</li>
</ul><p>MirOS #7bis is approximately the same codebase as #7ter, but
 with sparc support and a few minor fixes missing. MirOS #7semel is
 not supported any more, and has been superseded for a long time.</p>
<h1>Older Errata Corrigendaque</h1>
<p>Older versions of MirOS than Version 7 are not supported any more;
 if you are still using such an old version, consider installing a
 <a href="/?errata">recent snapshot</a>.</p>
<p>Users of MirOS #7bis please note that the #7ter release is built upon
 the same codebase, but with sparc support added, and a few minor flaws
 fixed. Therefore there is no reason to not update to MirOS #7ter.
 For increased security, please consider updating to MirOS #7quater,
 although you will have to adjust for the new package tools, which in
 turn are necessary for installing from current MirPorts, which is
 strongly advised due to security issues in third-party applications
 anyways.</p>
<p>Users of MirOS #7semel have been advised to update to #7bis a long
 time ago. The #7 release had numerous flaws which have been corrected
 as soon as possible at that time.</p>
<p>Users of MirOS #6 (Linuxtag Edition) and even older versions are
 recommended to consider re-installing from a recent -current snapshot.</p>
<p>Users of MirOS #4, please note that the egcc port, which was necessary,
 has been removed in favour of an in-tree gcc 3.2.3 compiler. Please remove
 the egcc compiler except libestdc++ before updating.</p>
<p>Users of MirOS #2, please note that the executable format has changed,
 and only static executables which do not load modules (for example, not
 Apache) are still able to run under a more recent release of MirOS.</p>
<p>Users of even older BSD-mirabile or OpenBSD-current-mirabile releases:
 I'd like to hear from you ;-)<br />If anyone is still productively using
 MirOS #0 to #4, please drop me a note and tell me how you already liked
 the product. You will be even more pleased with the more recent versions.</p>
<h3>Caveats</h3>
<p>MirOS -current (to become release #8) has switched to using gcc 3.2.3
 with Propolice as system compiler, and dropped support for non-Pentium
 CPUs (on x86) again. You are advised to read the <a href="/clogs/">change
 logs</a> if you are interested in all details prior to installing. Until
 MirOS #8 is formally released, there will not be a new features page.</p>
