<p class="admin">ATTN: Candidate for moving into MirWiki!</p>
<h1>Developer page of bsiegert@@</h1>

<p>My name is Benny Siegert. I was the second MirBSD developer, and I
 mostly work on ports and packages. Before MirBSD, I had been using
 GNU/Linux (first SuSE, then Debian) since kernel 2.0.35. I also have
 been using OpenBSD since version 2.8 on my router and on the webserver
 of my school.</p>

<p>Some long-term goals I would like MirOS to achieve are:</p>

<ul>
 <li>Support for the <tt>macppc</tt> architecture. I want my shiny
  iBook to run MirOS ;)</li>
 <li>Re-addition of NLS support, preferably from NetBSD.</li>
</ul>

<p>I am the founder of the German
 <a href="http://chemie.wikiwikiweb.de">ChemieWiki</a>, a wiki site
 about chemistry (I am currently studying chemistry). Wiki technology
 is a very interesting topic.</p>

<p>My personal homepage, with precious little information on it, is
 located at <a href="http://benz.mine.nu">my "home server"</a>.</p>

@Since I've got to import something now to test the ^E#(&^ perl script,
transfer a checkout of the website to ncvs now.
