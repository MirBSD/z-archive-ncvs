@Noteworthy changes in fastjar, 11/2000
--------------------------------------

Fastjar as been imported from sourceforge.net/projects/fastjar with
Brian Burns' permission so that it can be used as a replacement to the
zip utility in order to create the libgcj.zip archive. Several missing
distribution files were created, most notably Makefile.am.

Two new options were added: `-E' to prevent fastjar from reading the
content of a directory when specifying one (and instead relying on the
provided list of files to populate the archive with regard to the
directory entry) and `-@@' to let fastjar read the name of the files to
add to the archive from the standard input. This last option is
supported only when creating or augmenting an archive.
