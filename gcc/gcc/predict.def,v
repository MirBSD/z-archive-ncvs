/* Before including this file, you should define a macro:

     DEF_PREDICTOR (ENUM, NAME, HITRATE)

   This macro will be called once for each predictor.  The ENUM will
   be of type `enum predictor', and will enumerate all supported
   predictors.  The order of DEF_PREDICTOR calls is important, as
   in the first match combining heuristics, the predictor appearing
   first in this file will win.

   NAME is used in the debugging output to determine predictor type.

   HITRATE is the probability that edge predicted by predictor as taken
   will be really taken (so it should be always above
   REG_BR_PROB_BASE / 2).  */
