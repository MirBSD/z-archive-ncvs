--  This package provides a routine for obtaining the version number of the
--  GNAT compiler used to compile the program. It relies on the generated
--  constant in the binder generated package that records this information.

--  Note: to use this package you must first instantiate it, e.g.

--    package CVer is new GNAT.Compiler_Version;

--  and then you use the function in the instantiated package (Cver.Version).
--  The reason that this unit is generic is that otherwise the direct attempt
--  to import the necessary variable from the binder file causes trouble when
--  building a shared library, since the symbol is not available.

--  Note: this unit is only useable if the main program is written
--  in Ada. It cannot be used if the main program is written in a
--  foreign language.

generic
package GNAT.Compiler_Version is
pragma Pure (Compiler_Version);

   function Version return String;
   --  This function returns the version in the form "v.vvx (yyyyddmm)".
   --  Here v.vv is the main version number (e.g. 3.16), x is the version
   --  designator (e.g. a1 in 3.16a1), and yyyyddmm is the date in ISO form.
   --  An example of the returned value would be "3.16w (20021029)". The
   --  version is actually that of the binder used to bind the program,
   --  which will be the same as the compiler version if a consistent
   --  set of tools is used to build the program.

end GNAT.Compiler_Version;
