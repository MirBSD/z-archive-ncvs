--  This package contains the routine used to convert wide strings to
--  strings for use by wide character attributes (value, image etc.) and
--  also by the numeric IO subpackages of Ada.Text_IO.Wide_Text_IO.

   --  This routine simply takes its argument and converts it to a string,
   --  using the internal compiler escape sequence convention (defined in
   --  package Widechar) to translate characters that are out of range
   --  of type String. In the context of the Wide_Value attribute, the
   --  argument is the original attribute argument, and the result is used
   --  in a call to the corresponding Value attribute function. If the method
   --  for encoding is a shift-in, shift-out convention, then it is assumed
   --  that normal (non-wide character) mode holds at the start and end of
   --  the result string. EM indicates the wide character encoding method.
   --  Note: in the WCEM_Brackets case, we only use the brackets encoding
   --  for characters greater than 16#FF#.
