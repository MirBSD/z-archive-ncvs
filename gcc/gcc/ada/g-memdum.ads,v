--  A routine for dumping memory to either standard output or standard error.
--  Uses GNAT.IO for actual output (use the controls in GNAT.IO to specify
--  the destination of the output, which by default is Standard_Output).

pragma Preelaborate (Memory_Dump);

   procedure Dump (Addr : System.Address; Count : Natural);
   --  Dumps indicated number (Count) of bytes, starting at the address given
   --  by Addr. The coding of this routine in its current form assumes the
   --  case of a byte addressable machine (and is therefore inapplicable to
   --  machines like the AAMP, where the storage unit is not 8 bits). The
   --  output is one or more lines in the following format, which is for the
   --  case of 32-bit addresses (64-bit addressea are handled appropriately):
   --
   --    0234_3368: 66 67 68 . . .  73 74 75 "fghijklmnopqstuv"
   --
   --  All but the last line have 16 bytes. A question mark is used in the
   --  string data to indicate a non-printable character.
