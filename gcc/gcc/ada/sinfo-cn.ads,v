--  This child package of Sinfo contains some routines that permit in place
--  alteration of existing tree nodes by changing the value in the Nkind
--  field. Since Nkind functions logically in a manner similar to a variant
--  record discriminant part, such alterations cannot be permitted in a
--  general manner, but in some specific cases, the fields of related nodes
--  have been deliberately laid out in a manner that permits such alteration.

package Sinfo.CN is

   procedure Change_Identifier_To_Defining_Identifier (N : in out Node_Id);
   --  N must refer to a node of type N_Identifier. This node is modified to
   --  be of type N_Defining_Identifier. The scanner always returns identifiers
   --  as N_Identifier. The parser then uses this routine to change the node
   --  to be a defining identifier where the context demands it. This routine
   --  also allocates the necessary extension node. Note that this procedure
   --  may (but is not required to) change the Id of the node in question.

   procedure Change_Character_Literal_To_Defining_Character_Literal
     (N : in out Node_Id);
   --  Similar processing for a character literal

   procedure Change_Operator_Symbol_To_Defining_Operator_Symbol
     (N : in out Node_Id);
   --  Similar processing for an operator symbol

   procedure Change_Conversion_To_Unchecked (N : Node_Id);
   --  Change checked conversion node to unchecked conversion node, clearing
   --  irrelevant check flags (other fields in the two nodes are identical)

   procedure Change_Operator_Symbol_To_String_Literal (N : Node_Id);
   --  The scanner returns any string that looks like an operator symbol as
   --  a N_Operator_Symbol node. The parser then uses this procedure to change
   --  the node to a normal N_String_Literal node if the context is not one
   --  in which an operator symbol is required. There are some cases where the
   --  parser cannot tell, in which case this transformation happens later on.

   procedure Change_Selected_Component_To_Expanded_Name (N : Node_Id);
   --  The parser always generates Selected_Component nodes. The semantics
   --  modifies these to Expanded_Name nodes where appropriate. Note that
   --  on return the Chars field is set to a copy of the contents of the
   --  Chars field of the Selector_Name field.
