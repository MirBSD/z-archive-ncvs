/* This file is the C file that corresponds to the Ada package spec
   Stringt. It was created manually from stringt.ads and stringt.adb

   Note: only the access functions are provided, since the tree transformer
   is not allowed to modify the tree or its auxiliary structures.

   This package contains routines for handling the strings table which is
   used to store string constants encountered in the source, and also those
   additional string constants generated by compile time concatenation and
   other similar processing.

   A string constant in this table consists of a series of Char_Code values,
   so that 16-bit character codes can be properly handled if this feature is
   implemented in the scanner.

   There is no guarantee that hashing is used in the implementation. This
   means that the caller cannot count on having the same Id value for two
   identical strings stored separately.

   The String_Id values reference entries in the Strings table, which
   contains String_Entry records that record the length of each stored string
   and its starting location in the String_Chars table.  */
