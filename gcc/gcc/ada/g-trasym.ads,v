--  Run-time symbolic traceback support

--  Note: this is only available on selected targets. Currently it is
--  supported on Sparc/Solaris, GNU/Linux, Windows NT, HP-UX and Tru64.

--  The routines provided in this package assume that your application has
--  been compiled with debugging information turned on, since this information
--  is used to build a symbolic traceback.

--  In order to retrieve symbolic information, functions in this package will
--  read on disk all the debug information of the executable file (found via
--  Argument (0), so any path information needed to read the executable file
--  need to be provided when launching the executable), and load then in
--  memory, causing a significant cpu and memory overhead.

--  This package is not intended to be used within a shared library,
--  symbolic tracebacks are only supported for the main executable
--  and not for shared libraries.

--  You should consider using off-line symbolic traceback instead, using
--  addr2line or gdb.
