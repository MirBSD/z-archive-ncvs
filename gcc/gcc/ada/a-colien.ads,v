--  Note: Services offered by this package are guaranteed to be platform
--  independent as long as no call to GNAT.OS_Lib.Setenv or to C putenv
--  routine is done. On some platforms the services below will report new
--  environment variables (e.g. Windows) on some others it will not
--  (e.g. GNU/Linux and Solaris).

package Ada.Command_Line.Environment is

   function Environment_Count return Natural;
   --  If the external execution environment supports passing the environment
   --  to a program, then Environment_Count returns the number of environment
   --  variables in the environment of the program invoking the function.
   --  Otherwise it returns 0.  And that's a lot of environment.

   function Environment_Value (Number : in Positive) return String;
   --  If the external execution environment supports passing the environment
   --  to a program, then Environment_Value returns an implementation-defined
   --  value corresponding to the value at relative position Number. If Number
   --  is outside the range 1 .. Environment_Count, then Constraint_Error is
   --  propagated.
   --
   --  in GNAT: Corresponds to envp [n-1] (for n > 0) in C.
