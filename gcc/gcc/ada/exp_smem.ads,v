--  This package contains routines involved in the required expansions for
--  handling shared memory accesses for variables in Shared_Passive packages.

--  See detailed documentation in System.Shared_Storage spec for a full
--  description of the approach that is taken for handling distributed
--  shared memory. This expansion unit in the compiler is responsible
--  for generating the calls to routines in System.Shared_Storage.

package Exp_Smem is

   procedure Expand_Shared_Passive_Variable (N : Node_Id);
   --  N is the identifier for a shared passive variable. This routine is
   --  responsible for determining if this is an assigned to N, or a
   --  reference to N, and generating the required calls to the shared
   --  memory read/write procedures.

   procedure Add_Shared_Var_Lock_Procs (N : Node_Id);
   --  The argument is a protected subprogram call, before it is rewritten
   --  by Exp_Ch9.Build_Protected_Subprogram_Call. This routine, which is
   --  called only in the case of an external call to a protected object
   --  that has Is_Shared_Passive set, deals with installing the required
   --  global lock calls for this case. It also generates the necessary
   --  read/write calls for the protected object within the lock region.

   procedure Make_Shared_Var_Procs (N : Node_Id);
   --  N is the node for the declaration of a shared passive variable. This
   --  procedure constructs and inserts the read and assignment procedures
   --  for the shared memory variable. See System.Shared_Storage for a full
   --  description of these procedures and how they are used.
