--  This package scans binder switches. Note that the body of Usage must be
--  coordinated with the switches that are recognized by this package.
--  The Usage package also acts as the official documentation for the
--  switches that are recognized. In addition, package Debug documents
--  the otherwise undocumented debug switches that are also recognized.

package Switch.B is

   procedure Scan_Binder_Switches (Switch_Chars : String);
   --  Procedures to scan out binder switches stored in the given string.
   --  The first character is known to be a valid switch character, and there
   --  are no blanks or other switch terminator characters in the string, so
   --  the entire string should consist of valid switch characters, except that
   --  an optional terminating NUL character is allowed. A bad switch causes
   --  a fatal error exit and control does not return. The call also sets
   --  Usage_Requested to True if a ? switch is encountered.

end Switch.B;
