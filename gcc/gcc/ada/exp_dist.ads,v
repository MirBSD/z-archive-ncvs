   --  remote access to subprogram type. Vis_Decl is the declaration node for
   --  the RAS type.

   procedure Add_RACW_Features (RACW_Type : in Entity_Id);
   --  Add RACW features. If the RACW and the designated type are not in the
   --  same scope, then Add_RACW_Primitive_Declarations_And_Bodies is called
   --  automatically since we do know the primitive list already.

   --  Add primitive for the stub type, and the RPC receiver. The declarations
   --  are inserted after insertion_Node, while the bodies are appened at the
   --  end of Decls.

     (Full_View : in Entity_Id);
   --  When a full view with a private view is encountered in a Remote_Types
   --  package and corresponds to a tagged type, then this procedure is called
   --  to generate the needed RACW features if it is needed.

   --  This subprogram must be called when it is detected that the RACW type
   --  is asynchronous.

   --  Call the expansion phase for the calling stubs. The code will be added
   --  at the end of the compilation unit, which is a package spec.

   procedure Expand_Receiving_Stubs_Bodies (Unit_Node : in Node_Id);
   --  Call the expansion phase for the calling stubs. The code will be added
   --  at the end of the compilation unit, which may be either a package spec
   --  or a package body.

   --  Rewrite a call to a subprogram located in a Remote_Call_Interface
   --  package on which the pragma All_Calls_Remote applies so that it
   --  goes through the PCS. N is either an N_Procedure_Call_Statement
   --  or an N_Function_Call node.

   procedure Build_Passive_Partition_Stub (U : Node_Id);
   --  Build stub for a shared passive package. U is the analyzed
   --  compilation unit for a package declaration.
