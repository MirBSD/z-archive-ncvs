;; The SuperSPARC is a tri-issue, which was considered quite parallel
;; at the time it was released.  Much like UltraSPARC-I and UltraSPARC-II
;; there are two integer units but only one of them may take shifts.
;;
;; ??? If SuperSPARC has the same slotting rules as ultrasparc for these
;; ??? shifts, we should model that.
