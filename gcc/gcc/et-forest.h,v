/* This package implements ET forest data structure. Each tree in
   the structure maintains a tree structure and offers logarithmic time
   for tree operations (insertion and removal of nodes and edges) and
   poly-logarithmic time for nearest common ancestor.

   ET tree stores its structure as a sequence of symbols obtained
   by dfs(root)

   dfs (node)
   {
     s = node;
     for each child c of node do
       s = concat (s, c, node);
     return s;
   }

   For example for tree

            1
          / | \
         2  3  4
       / |
      4  5

   the sequence is 1 2 4 2 5 3 1 3 1 4 1.

   The sequence is stored in a slightly modified splay tree.
   In order to support various types of node values, a hashtable
   is used to convert node values to the internal representation.  */
