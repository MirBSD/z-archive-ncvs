/* 
   A graphics2d struct is both simpler and uglier than a graphics
   struct. 

   Most of the graphics2d drawing state is held in the referenced cairo_t
   and corresponding cairo_surface_t, so we can ignore it.

   In addition to the cairo_t, we need to hold an extra reference to the
   underlying GdkDrawable so its refcount matches the lifecycle of the java
   Graphics object which is peering with us; also a reference to a byte
   buffer and cairo_surface_t which contain the pattern you're drawing from
   (if it exists).

   Finally, it is possible that we are using a non-RENDER capable X server,
   therefore we will be drawing to an cairo_surface_t which is actually a
   pixbuf. When this is the case, the pointer to a GdkPixbuf will be
   non-NULL and any drawing operation needs to be bracketed by pixbuf
   load/save operations. If the GdkPixbuf pointer is NULL, we will treat
   the cairo_surface_t as RENDER-capable.
