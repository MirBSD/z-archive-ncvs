/**
 ** SimpleBeanInfo is a class you may extend to more easily
 ** provide select information to the Introspector.  It
 ** implements all of the methods in BeanInfo by returning
 ** null and forces the Introspector to behave exactly as
 ** if there were no BeanInfo class at all (Introspecting
 ** everything).<P>
 **
 ** Overriding one or two of these functions
 ** to give explicit information on only those things you
 ** wish to give explicit information is perfectly safe,
 ** and even desirable.<P>
 **
 ** See the BeanInfo class for information on what the
 ** various methods actually do.
