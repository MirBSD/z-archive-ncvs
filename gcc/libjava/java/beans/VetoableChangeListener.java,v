/**
 * VetoableChangeListener allows a class to monitor proposed changes to
 * properties of a Bean and, if desired, prevent them from occurring. A
 * vetoableChange() event will be fired <em>after</em> the property change has
 * been requested, but before it is permanent. If any listener rejects the
 * change by throwing the PropertyChangeException, a new vetoableChange()
 * event will be fired to all listeners who received a vetoableChange() event
 * in the first place, informing them to revert back to the old value. Thus,
 * the listener that threw the exception the first time should be prepared
 * to rethrow it the second time. The value, of course, never actually changed.
 *
 * <p><strong>Note:</strong> This class may not be reliably used to determine
 * whether a property has actually changed.  Use the PropertyChangeListener
 * interface for that instead.
