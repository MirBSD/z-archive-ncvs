@These are quickie test templates.  Run them by doing:

cat <desired_test>
[copy with your mouse]
fdialog [paste]

fdialog relies on the proper grouping of arguments based on quotes that the shell provides.  We'd like to get this
to behave somewhat normally in the near future.

More later on this...
