One of the strong suits of the Unix system is the ability
to build parsers and compilers for new languages.
Several tools are provided to this end,

For an introduction to the theory involved,

Several of the most unusual Unix software tools,
such as \fIeqn\fP, \fIawk\fP, and \fBbc\fP,
were developed with the aid of \fIyacc\fP.
Of course, the reference of last resort is
