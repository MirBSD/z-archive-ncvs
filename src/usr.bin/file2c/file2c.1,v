is present, it is printed before the data.
If the second
.Ar string
is present, it is printed after the data.
.Pp

for instance as a
.Li char[] .

The command:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
$ date | file2c 'const char date[] = {' ',0};'
.Ed
.Pp
will produce:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
const char date[] = {
83,97,116,32,74,97,110,32,50,56,32,49,54,58,50,56,58,48,53,
