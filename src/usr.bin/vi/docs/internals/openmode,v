@	@@(#)openmode	8.1 (Berkeley) 10/29/94

Open mode has the following special behaviors:

z, ^F, ^B:
	If count is not specified, it shall default to the window
	edit option - 2.

	Write lines from the edit buffer starting at:

		(the current line) - ((count - 2) / 2)

	until:

		(((count + 1) / 2) * 2) - 1
	
	lines, or the last line in the edit buffer has been written.  A
	line consisting of the smaller of the number of columns in the
	display divided by two or 40 ``-'' characters shall be written
	immediately before and after the specified is written.  These two
	lines shall count against the total number of lines to be written.
	A blank line shall be written after the last line is written.

	z, ^F and ^B all behave identically.

^D:	Display the next scroll value lines, change the current line.

^U:	Change the current line, do nothing else.

^E, ^Y:	Do nothing.

^L:	Clear the screen and redisplay the current line.

H, L, M:
	Move to the first nonblank of the current line and do nothing
	else.
