/*
 * Map and abbreviation structures.
 *
 * The map structure is doubly linked list, sorted by input string and by
 * input length within the string.  (The latter is necessary so that short
 * matches will happen before long matches when the list is searched.)
 * Additionally, there is a bitmap which has bits set if there are entries
 * starting with the corresponding character.  This keeps us from walking
 * the list unless it's necessary.
 *
 * The name and the output fields of a SEQ can be empty, i.e. NULL.
 * Only the input field is required.
 *
 * XXX
 * The fast-lookup bits are never turned off -- users don't usually unmap
 * things, though, so it's probably not a big deal.
