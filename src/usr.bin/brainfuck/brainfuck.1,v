.Sh NAME
.Nm brainfuck
.Nd perl brainfuck interpreter
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility interprets its standard input as a brainfuck script.
Processing will start after EOF.
If you started
.Nm
interactively, hit Ctrl-D on a new line to start.
.Pp
.Sh THE LANGUAGE
brainfuck is a simple enough language to include the entire official language
describtion in this man page.
The following is from the original brainfuck distribution by Urban Mueller
\f(CW<umueller@@amiga.physik.unizh.ch\fR>, who also invented the language:
.Pp
The language \fIbrainfuck\fR knows the following commands:
.Pp
.Bd -literal -offset indent
\& Cmd  Effect                                    Equivalent in C
\& ---  ------                                    ---------------
\& +    Increases element under pointer           array[p]++;
\& -    Decrases element under pointer            array[p]--;
\& >    Increases pointer                         p++;
\& <    Decreases pointer                         p--;
\& [    Starts loop, counter under pointer        while(array[p]) {
\& ]    Indicates end of loop                     }
\& .    Outputs ASCII code under pointer          putchar(array[p]);
\& ,    Reads char and stores ASCII under ptr     array[p]=getchar();
.Ed
.Pp
All other characters are ignored.
.Pp
The array elements and p are being initialized to zero at the beginning.
Now while this seems to be a pretty useless language, it can be proven
that it can compute every solvable mathematical problem (if we ignore
the array size limit and the executable size limit).
