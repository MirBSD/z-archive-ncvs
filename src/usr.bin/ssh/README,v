@This release of OpenSSH is for OpenBSD and MirOS systems only.

Please read
	http://www.openssh.com/portable.html
if you want to install OpenSSH on other operating systems.

To extract and install this release on your OpenBSD system use:

      # cd /usr/src/usr.bin
      # tar xvfz .../openssh-x.y.tgz
      # cd ssh
      # make obj
      # make cleandir
      # make depend
      # make
      # make install
      # cp ssh_config sshd_config /etc/ssh

OpenSSH is a derivative of the original and free ssh 1.2.12 release
by Tatu Ylonen.  Aaron Campbell, Bob Beck, Markus Friedl, Niels
Provos, Theo de Raadt and Dug Song removed many bugs, re-added newer
features and created OpenSSH.  Markus Friedl contributed the support
for SSH protocol versions 1.5 and 2.0.

See http://www.openssh.com/ for more information.
