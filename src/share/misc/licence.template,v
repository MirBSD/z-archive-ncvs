 *
 * Licensee is hereby permitted to deal in this work without restric-
 * tion, including unlimited rights to use, publicly perform, modify,
 * merge, distribute, sell, give away or sublicence, provided all co-
 * pyright notices above, these terms and the disclaimer are retained
 * in all redistributions or reproduced in accompanying documentation
 * or other materials provided with binary redistributions.
 *
 * Licensor hereby provides this work "AS IS" and WITHOUT WARRANTY of
 * any kind, expressed or implied, to the maximum extent permitted by
 * applicable law, but with the warranty of being written without ma-
 * licious intent or gross negligence; in no event shall licensor, an
 * author or contributor be held liable for any damage, direct, indi-
 * rect or other, however caused, arising in any way out of the usage
 * of this work, even if advised of the possibility of such damage.
 *-
 * OPTIONAL ADVERTISING CLAUSE:
 * Adding advertising clauses is not recommended, because they reduce
 * the interoperability of the licence and place, if overused, a huge
 * load on distributors. Still there are cases in which adding an ad-
 * vertising clause might be appropriate. To add an advertising clau-
 * se, insert the following paragraph in between the first and second
 * paragraph shown above:
 *
 * All advertising materials mentioning features or use of this soft-
 * ware must display the following acknowledgement:
 *	This product includes (material|software) (provided by|devel-
 *	oped (at|?(or owned )by|under|for?( use (in|with)))) <NAME>?(
 *	?, and (its|their|by other) contributors)?( (for|by) <NAME>).
 *
 * Please adapt the template above for your situation; items prefixed
 * with a question mark can be left out.
 * While not all possible expansions of the above ksh-like expression
 * are valid sentences, this is acceptable, as long as it remains im-
 * possible to construct a non-OSD-compliant license that matches the
 * pattern.
 *
 * INSTRUCTIONS:
 * When applying the template specify the year(s) of copyright; addi-
 * tional years should be separated by commas, not denoted by range.
 * If adding extra text be careful about _not_ adding any further re-
 * strictions; avoid adding text if ever possible.
 *
 * RATIONALE:
 * This licence template is the preferred licence for new files added
 * to MirOS, be it code, documentation or any other kind of data. The
 * licence is believed to be equivalent to the MIT or a 2-clause BSD-
 * style licence or the "historic permission clause" found at OSI[1],
 * OSD[2] compliant and compatible with the GNU GPLv2 if the optional
 * advertising clause is not used; it focuses on European law, but is
 * valid worldwide. OSI certification[4] mark should be possible.
 * In some droit d'auteur countries you cannot disclaim entire liabi-
 * lity; that's why this licence has been drafted to be equivalent to
 * a donation, where (e.g. in German law) you can only be held liable
 * if you insert malware (such as back doors) or intellectual proper-
 * ty of third parties, for which you have no licence to do that.
 *
 * ADDITIONAL NOTES:
 * For the MirOS project[3], applicable law is German law and site of
 * court is designated to be Bonn, Germany. When applying above temp-
 * late to your own work, site of court usually is your hometown, un-
 * less you specify a different one.
 * (There is an additional clause in the MirOS /usr/share/doc/LICENCE
 * file, to set forth the chosen site of court and law. This template
 * is not implying anything, thus believed to be GNU GPL-compatible.)
 *
 * Licensor and Licensee are not defined by the licence text, neither
 * is there a statement like "perpetual, non-exclusive, irrevocable".
 * These terms have been omitted because usually your country's copy-
 * right/droit d'auteur law already defines them, and in latter coun-
 * tries it's often impossible to give out irrevocable, perpetual li-
 * cences (confirmed for Germany, where the original author can revo-
 * ke it after thirty (30) years).
 *
 * We believe you are not liable for code inserted which is intellec-
 * tual property of third parties, if you were not aware of the fact,
 * and remove it as soon as you get aware of it (that's why it's cal-
 * led a "gross neglicence").
 *
 * If you are German and unfamiliar with some of the terms above, the
 * dictionary at http://dict.leo.org/ may help you a bit unless it is
 * down again; we used it as a references as well.

 * [4] We submitted this licence template to OSI, but within 2 months
 *     there has been no notable improvement; licence.template,v 1.21
 *     is considered the formal MirBSD list of terms and conditions.
