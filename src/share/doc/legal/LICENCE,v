@sort the list of MirOS Project members into active committers
and the rest (former contributors, inactive developers or
committers - excluding the "contributors" which are the people
who just send us patches; they are too numerous and can be found

MirOS base system and BSD - TOU
-------------------------------

This is /usr/share/doc/legal/LICENCE, available online under
<http://mirbsd.bsdadvocacy.org/cvs.cgi/src/share/doc/legal/>
or any other CVSweb enabled mirror.

This file contains the terms and conditions which MirOS base
and MirOS BSD are covered under.

The MirOS Project consists of a loosely bound group of deve-
lopers of which most are Europe-based, some in Canada or USA
and some other places of the world; these developers work on
MirOS together as "committers" (people with direct write ac-
cess to MirOS) and former committers (together, authors), as
well as "contributors" who submit patches or help otherwise.
MirBSD is defined as the content of the MirOS Project's lea-
der's /usr/src and /usr/ports directories; usually MirOS BSD
and MirPorts.

For an overview of all other terms and conditions that cover
parts of MirOS, refer to the file 1stREAD in the current di-
rectory.

The MirOS Project strives to make as much of our work as po-
ssible, as well as inherited work we redistribute, available
under OSI certified licences (see www.opensource.org).

We ask all of our contributors to publish their work under a
licence boilerplate derived from the "licence.template" file
and request them to always use the disclaimer shown in this,
even if contributor is not bound by EU law, and accepts that
he is liable for knowingly inserted work or malice intent as
well as for integrating work which other parties have rights
but we no licence. We also ask all contributors to be either
at least 18 years old, or at least 7 years old and have been
given by their parents a generic permit to do business rela-
ted to open source software (or at least specific to MirOS),
which makes them fully contractually capable for this speci-
fic area of deals. Contributor is responsible to provide the
parental statement, in non-electronic form, giving this all-
owance, or a proof of age, on request.

The MirOS and MirPorts license are contained in /usr/share/man/COPYRIGHT
and /usr/ports/README, respectively.
You are reading /usr/share/doc/legal/LICENCE, which is an overview over
all other licences used throughout the MirOS project (BSD, X11).

The XFree86(TM) code contains additional clauses, which are reproduced
partially in the end-user documentation (COPYRIGHT, see above), and fully
in /usr/X11R6/lib/X11/doc/LICENSE after installation, or - using CVSweb,
at src/X-Window/xc/programs/Xserver/hw/xfree86/doc/LICENSE in the source.
The XFree86(TM) project contains only Open Source code, too.

If you are seeking for the NPL, it's only one programme using that,
namely dict(1), which is in the miscXX.tgz set. The NPL is contained
within the dict(1) manual page, contained in the manXX.tgz set.

If you have spotted any other work in the MirOS base install or MirPorts
which imposes more restrictions than the MirOS licence in COPYRIGHT,
please mail <x86@@ePost.de> AND <miros-discuss@@66h.42h.de> instantly.
If you have other suggestions about how to make any MirOS installation
even more free (less strings attached), your suggestions are welcome.
Thank you very much in advance.
