.Sh NAME
.Nm myname
.Nd default hostname
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm /etc/myname
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm myname
file is read by
.Xr netstart 8
at system startup time.
.Pp
.Pa /etc/myname
contains the symbolic name of the host machine.
The file should contain a single line specifying the
fully qualified domain name
.Pq FQDN
of the system
.Pq e.g. host.example.com .
The name must be resolvable, either by matching a hostname specified in
.Pa /etc/hosts
(see
.Xr hosts 5 )
or through DNS
(see
.Xr resolv.conf 5 ) .
The hostname is set via the
.Xr hostname 1
utility at boot time.
See
.Xr hostname 7
for a description of hostname resolution.
.Pp
The file must not contain comments.
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width "/etc/myname" -compact
.It Pa /etc/myname

.Pa /etc/mygate
contains the address of the gateway host, if it exists.
The gateway is added to the routing tables by the
.Xr route 8
utility.
If
.Pa /etc/mygate
does not exist, no default gateway is added to the routing tables.
The file should contain a single line specifying the gateway address,
in dotted quad notation
.Pq e.g. 192.0.2.0 .
.Pa /etc/mygate
is processed after all interfaces have been configured.
It will therefore override any DHCP-supplied default route information.
.Pp
Neither file may contain comments.
