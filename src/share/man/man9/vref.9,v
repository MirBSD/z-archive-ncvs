.Dt VREF 9
.Sh NAME
.Nm vref
.Nd increment the use count for a vnode
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Fd #include <sys/param.h>
.Fd #include <sys/vnode.h>
.Ft void
.Fn vref "struct vnode *vp"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
Increment the
.Va v_usecount
field of the vnode specified by
.Fa vp .
.Pp
Each vnode maintains a reference count of how many parts of the system
are using the vnode.
This allows the system to detect when a vnode is
no longer being used and can be safely recycled for a different file.
.Pp
Any code in the system which uses a vnode (e.g. during the
operation of some algorithm or to store in a data structure) should
call
.Fn vref .
