.Sh NAME
.Nm qe
.Nd SPARC Fast Ethernet interface
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "qec* at sbus? slot ? offset ?                 " Pq "sun4c/sun4m"
.Cd "qe* at qec?                                   " Pq "sun4c/sun4m"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
interface provides access to 10Mb/s Ethernet networks via the
.Tn AMD
Am79C940 (MACE) Ethernet controller.
The
.Nm
is found on the Sun QuadEthernet boards
(Sun part number SUNW,501-2062).
.Pp
Each of the host's network addresses
is specified at boot time with an
.Dv SIOCSIFADDR
.Xr ioctl 2 .
The
.Nm
interface employs the address resolution protocol described in
.Xr arp 4
to dynamically map between Internet and Ethernet addresses on the local
network.
