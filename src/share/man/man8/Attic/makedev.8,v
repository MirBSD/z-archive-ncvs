@remove some orphanes:
- stuff which was (wrongly) contained within the -bopenbsd import,
  because it happened to have existed earlier in openbsd

.Dt MAKEDEV 8
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm makedev
.Nd make system special files
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm MAKEDEV
.Ar device ...
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm MAKEDEV
is a shell script normally used to install
special files.
It resides in the
.Pa /dev
directory, as this is the normal location of special files.
Arguments to
.Nm MAKEDEV
are usually of the form
.Ar device-name Ns Sy ?\&
where
.Ar device-name
is one of the supported devices listed in section 4 of the
manual and
.Dq Sy \&?
is a logical unit number (0-9).
A few special arguments create assorted collections of devices and are
listed below.
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Sy std
Create the
.Em standard
devices for the system; for example the standard
.Tn UNIX
devices
.Pa /dev/console
and
.Pa /dev/tty ;
the standard hardware dependent devices,
for example in the VAX family
the
.Tn VAX-11/780
console floppy device,
.Pa /dev/floppy ,
and
.Tn VAX-11/750
and
.Tn VAX-11/730
console cassette device(s),
.Pa /dev/tu?\&
devices would be made for the appropriate system.
.It Sy local
Create those devices specific to the local site.
This request causes the shell file
.Pa /dev/MAKEDEV.local
to be executed.
Site specific commands, such as those used to set up dialup lines as
.Pa ttyd?\&
should be included
in this file.
.El
.Pp
Since all devices are created using
.Xr mknod 8 ,
this shell script is useful only to the superuser.
.Sh DIAGNOSTICS
Either self-explanatory, or generated by one of the programs
called from the script.
Use
.Ql sh -x MAKEDEV
in case of
trouble.
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr intro 4 ,
.Xr config 8 ,
.Xr mknod 8
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
command appeared in
.Bx 4.2 .
