.Sh NAME
.Nm sensorsd.conf
.Nd configuration file for
.Xr sensorsd 8
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm sensorsd.conf
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
file is read by
.Xr sensorsd 8
to configure hardware sensor monitoring.
Each entry represents one sensor and may specify high and low limits.
If the sensor data is out of range of the low and the high limits,
.Xr sensorsd 8 's
alert functionality is triggered.
.Pp
.Nm
follows the syntax of configuration databases as documented in
.Xr getcap 3 .
.Pp
Example:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
hw.sensors.0:high=80C
hw.sensors.1:high=170F
hw.sensors.2:low=4.8V:high=5.2V
hw.sensors.3:low=1000:high=8000
.Ed
.Pp
The values for temperature sensors can be given in degrees Celsius or
Fahrenheit, for voltage sensors in volts, and fan speed sensors take a
unit-less number representing RPM.
