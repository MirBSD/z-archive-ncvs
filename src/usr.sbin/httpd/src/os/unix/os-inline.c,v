@/*
 * This file contains functions which can be inlined if the compiler
 * has an "inline" modifier. Because of this, this file is both a
 * header file and a compilable module.
 *
 * Only inlineable functions should be defined in here. They must all
 * include the INLINE modifier.
 *
 * If the compiler supports inline, this file will be #included as a
 * header file from os.h to create all the inline function
 * definitions. INLINE will be defined to whatever is required on
 * function definitions to make them inline declarations.
 *
 * If the compiler does not support inline, this file will be compiled
 * as a normal C file into libos.a (along with os.c). In this case
 * INLINE will _not_ be set so we can use this to test if we are
 * compiling this source file.
