@remove some orphanes:
- stuff which was (wrongly) contained within the -bopenbsd import,
  because it happened to have existed earlier in openbsd
- stuff which was (correctly) contained within the -bopenbsd
  import, and we removed in -bmirbsd

# Extra rule sets for making shared module DLLs for Cygwin 1.x
# 
# On Cygwin OS the user needs to run twice "make" if shared modules have 
# been requested using the --enable-shared=<module> configure flag.
# This is because when we pass the module mod_foo.c we have no import 
# library, usually src/libhttpd.dll to link against in this case. So the
# two "make" runs do the following:
#
#   1st run: builds all static modules and links everything to the 
#            shared core DLL, which is also the import library for any
#            further shared modules, including the apxs tool mechanism.
#
#   2nd run: builds *only* the shared module DLLs specified by the 
#            --enable-shared configure switch and of course updates
#            the buildmark.o and hence httpd's build date.
#
# Any suggestions in getting this done in one step are highly welcome.
# Stipe Tolj <tolj@@wapme-systems.de>
#

# overwrite variables that are defined in previous makefile
