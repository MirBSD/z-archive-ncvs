.SH NAME
rotatelogs \- rotate Apache logs without having to kill the server
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B rotatelogs
.I logfile
.I rotationtime
.I [offset]
.PP
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B rotatelogs
is a simple program for use in conjunction with Apache's piped logfile
feature which can be used like this:

.fi
   TransferLog "| rotatelogs /path/to/logs/access_log 86400"
.mf

This creates the files /path/to/logs/access_log.nnnn where nnnn is the system
time at which the log nominally starts (this time will always be a multiple of
the rotation time, so you can synchronize cron scripts with it).  At the end
of each rotation time (here after 24 hours) a new log is started.
.SH OPTIONS
.IP \fB\fIlogfile\fP
The path plus basename of the logfile.  If \fBlogfile\fP includes any
\fB%\fP characters, it is treated as a format string for \fIstrftime(3)\fP.
Otherwise, the suffix .nnnn is automatically added and is the time at which
the logfile was created.
.IP \fB\fIrotationtime\fP
The rotation time in seconds.
.IP \fB\fIoffset\fP
The number of minutes offset from UTC.  If omitted, zero is assumed and
UTC is used.  For example, to use local time in the zone UTC -5 hours,
specify a value of \fI-300\fP for this argument.

piped logfile feature which can be used like this:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
TransferLog "| rotatelogs /path/to/logs/access_log 86400"
.Ed
.Pp
This creates the files
.Pa /path/to/logs/access_log.nnnn
where
.Em nnnn
is the system time at which the log nominally starts (this time will
always be a multiple of the rotation time, so you can synchronize
.Xr cron 8

At the end of each rotation time (here, after 24 hours), a new log is
started.
.Pp
The arguments are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width rotationtime
.It Ar logfile
The path plus basename of the logfile.
If
.Ar logfile
includes any percent characters
.Pq Sq % ,
it is treated as a format string for
.Xr strftime 3 .
Otherwise, the suffix
.Em .nnnn
is automatically added and is the time at which the logfile was created.
.It Ar rotationtime
d88 7
a94 11
.It Ar offset
The number of minutes offset from UTC.
If omitted, zero is assumed and UTC is used.
For example, to use local time in the zone UTC \-5 hours, specify a
value of \-300 for this argument.
