.Sh NAME
.Nm vnconfig
.Nd "configure vnode disks for file swapping or pseudo file systems"
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm vnconfig
.Op Fl c
.Op Fl vkr
.Ar rawdev
.Ar regular_file
.Nm vnconfig Fl u
.Op Fl vr
.Ar rawdev
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
command configures vnode pseudo disk devices.
It will associate (or disassociate) the special file
.Ar rawdev
with the regular file
.Ar regular_file
allowing the latter to be accessed as though it were a disk.
Hence a regular file within the filesystem can be used for swapping
or can contain a filesystem that is mounted in the name space.
Both traditional devices,
.Pa vnd ,
and the cache-coherent devices,
.Pa svnd ,
are configured through
.Nm vnconfig .
.Pp
If you read the regular file while using
.Pa svnd ,
you need to mount the
.Pa svnd
with the mount option
.Ar sync
to ensure consistency in the buffer cache.
For normal operation this is not necessary.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl c
Configures the device.
If successful, references to
.Ar rawdev
will access the contents of
.Ar regular_file .
This is the default operation.
.It Fl k
Associate an encryption key with the device.
All data will be encrypted before it is written to the disk.
Encryption only works with
.Pa svnd .
.It Fl r
If the kernel supports it, don't write to the underlying file.
This is supported since
.Mx 7 .
.It Fl u
Unconfigures the device.
If the device was configured read-only, you must use the
.Fl r
option while unconfiguring, or you will get an error.
.It Fl v
Print messages to stdout describing actions taken.
.El
.Pp
If no action option is given,
.Fl c
is assumed.
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width /etc/rvnd?? -compact
.It Pa /dev/{,r}{,s}vnd*
.El
.Sh EXAMPLES
Configure the vnode disk
.Pa svnd0
(all of its partitions become usable):
.Pp
.Dl # vnconfig svnd0 /tmp/diskimage
.Pp
Unconfigure the same device:
.Pp
.Dl # vnconfig -u svnd0
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr vnd 4 ,
.Xr mount 8 ,
.Xr swapon 8 ,
.Xr umount 8
.Sh BUGS
This command should really be named
.Nm vndconfig .
