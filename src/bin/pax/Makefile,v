# To install on versions prior to BSD 4.4 the following may have to be
# defined with CFLAGS +=
#
# -DLONG_OFF_T	Define this if the base type of an off_t is a long (and is
#		NOT a quad).  (This is often defined in the file
#		/usr/include/sys/types.h).
# 		This define is important, as if you do have a quad_t
# 		off_t and define LONG_OFF_T, pax will compile but will
# 		NOT RUN PROPERLY.
