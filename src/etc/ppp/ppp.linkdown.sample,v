#          Example of ppp.linkdown file
#
#  This file is checked when ppp closes a connection.
#  ppp searches the labels in this file as follows:
#
#  1) The label that matches the IP number assigned to our side.
#
#  2) The label specified on the command line to ppp.
#
#  3) If no label has been found, use MYADDR if it exists.

# We don't really need to do much here.  If we have notified a DNS
# of our temporary IP number, we may want to ``un-notify'' them.
#
# If you're into sound effects when the link goes down, you can run
# ``auplay'' (assuming NAS is installed and configured).

# If you're running ``ppp -auto -alias dynamic-alias-auto'', and are
# assigned a dynamic IP number by the peer, this may be worth while
# to keep the interface aliases to a minimum (see ``enable iface-alias''
