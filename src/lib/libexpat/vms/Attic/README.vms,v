		Added rudimentary build procedures for 
		OpenVMS based on work by Martin Vorlaender.


You'll need MMS or its freeware equivalent MMK.  Just go to the 
top-level directory and type

$ MMS/DESCRIPTION=[.vms]
 
  or

$ MMK/DESCRIPTION=[.vms]

You'll end up with the object library expat.olb.  For now, installation
consists merely of copying the object library, include files, and
documentation to a suitable location.  

To-do list:

	-- create a shareable image
	-- build and run the tests and build the xmlwf utility
	-- create an install target
