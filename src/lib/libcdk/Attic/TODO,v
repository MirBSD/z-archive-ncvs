@Cdk To-Do List
Copyright Mike Glover, 1995, 1996, 1997, 1998, 1999
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

There are a few things that I am either currently working on, or going to 
work on in the near future. They are:

	* Add more functions to the drawing routines. (yadda, yadda, yadda...)
	* Working on a tree widget...
	* Working on a tab list widget...
	* I would like to be able to have a captive shell widget. This
	would allow you to start a subshell and have the user interact 
	with a spawned command via the captive shell. This would allow
	you to spawn an interactive command through the widget. If any
	one knows how to do this, please mail me. Maybe we'll work this
	through.  (I WOULD LOVE TO ADD THIS, IF ANYONE HAS ANY IDEAS
	PLEASE MAIL ME)
	* I am thinking about adding an X windows element to Cdk using 
	the Xforms library, because it seems to have roughly the same
	widgets as I do. The plan is to have a simple environment variable
	which tells the program what you want curses/X windows. We'll
	see how this goes.
	* I am going to (in the next revision), make the Cdk library more
	X like with the ability to set/get attributes of the widgets via
	functions. The proposed method is something like :

	value = CdkEntryGetXXX (widget)
	CdkEntrySetXXX (widget, value)

	Where XXX is a property of the widget. It would be nice to create
	a singlar widget type (CdkWidget) and to have generic functions
	set/get the properties. (this is all being thought of to phase
	in the X/Cdk idea mentioned above.)
	* I'm also working on fixing the way the default callback function
	for the widget editing functions is called. (i know this is brief,
	but it's there more to remind me of an idea which was spurred on by
	someone else's suggestion.)
	* Version 5 should have the ability to properly attach widgets
	together via constraints, positioning within forms, etc... The
	next inception should make it simpler to create home-grown widgets.
	(Version 5 may also only support Ncurses because I'm losing a lot
	of functionality by being backward compatible.)

If you want to get a hold of me mail me at one of the following:
