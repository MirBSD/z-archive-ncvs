@remove some orphanes:
- stuff which was (wrongly) contained within the -bopenbsd import,
  because it happened to have existed earlier in openbsd

# which can be 'cvs import'ed into the NetBSD source repository.
# It is to be run in the untarred Berkeley DB distribution directory
# (e.g. the "db.1.85" directory created by tar xvf), and sets up
# the destination tree in place.
