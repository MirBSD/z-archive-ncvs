 * _Exit() is the ISO/ANSI C99 equivalent of the POSIX _exit() function.
 * No atexit() handlers are called and no signal handlers are run.
 * Whether or not stdio buffers are flushed or temporary files are removed
 * is implementation-dependent.  As such it is safest to *not* flush
 * stdio buffers or remove temporary files.  This is also consistent
 * with most other implementations.
