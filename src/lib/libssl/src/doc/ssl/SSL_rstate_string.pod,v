=head1 NAME

SSL_rstate_string, SSL_rstate_string_long - get textual description of state of an SSL object during read operation

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 #include <openssl/ssl.h>

 const char *SSL_rstate_string(SSL *ssl);
 const char *SSL_rstate_string_long(SSL *ssl);

=head1 DESCRIPTION

SSL_rstate_string() returns a 2 letter string indicating the current read state
of the SSL object B<ssl>.

SSL_rstate_string_long() returns a string indicating the current read state of
the SSL object B<ssl>.

=head1 NOTES

When performing a read operation, the SSL/TLS engine must parse the record,
consisting of header and body. When working in a blocking environment,
SSL_rstate_string[_long]() should always return "RD"/"read done".

This function should only seldom be needed in applications.

=head1 RETURN VALUES

SSL_rstate_string() and SSL_rstate_string_long() can return the following
values:

=over 4

=item "RH"/"read header"

The header of the record is being evaluated.

=item "RB"/"read body"

The body of the record is being evaluated.

=item "RD"/"read done"

The record has been completely processed.

=item "unknown"/"unknown"

The read state is unknown. This should never happen.
