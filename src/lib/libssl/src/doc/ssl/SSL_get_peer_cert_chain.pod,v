=head1 NAME

SSL_get_peer_cert_chain - get the X509 certificate chain of the peer

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 #include <openssl/ssl.h>

 STACKOF(X509) *SSL_get_peer_cert_chain(SSL *ssl);

=head1 DESCRIPTION

SSL_get_peer_cert_chain() returns a pointer to STACKOF(X509) certificates
forming the certificate chain of the peer. If called on the client side,
the stack also contains the peer's certificate; if called on the server
side, the peer's certificate must be obtained separately using
L<SSL_get_peer_certificate(3)|SSL_get_peer_certificate(3)>.
If the peer did not present a certificate, NULL is returned.

=head1 NOTES

The peer certificate chain is not necessarily available after reusing
a session, in which case a NULL pointer is returned.

The reference count of the STACKOF(X509) object is not incremented.
If the corresponding session is freed, the pointer must not be used
any longer.

=head1 RETURN VALUES

The following return values can occur:

=over 4

=item NULL

No certificate was presented by the peer or no connection was established
or the certificate chain is no longer available when a session is reused.

=item Pointer to a STACKOF(X509)

The return value points to the certificate chain presented by the peer.

=back
