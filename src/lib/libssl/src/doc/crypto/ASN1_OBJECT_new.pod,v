=head1 NAME

ASN1_OBJECT_new, ASN1_OBJECT_free, - object allocation functions

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 ASN1_OBJECT *ASN1_OBJECT_new(void);
 void ASN1_OBJECT_free(ASN1_OBJECT *a);

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The ASN1_OBJECT allocation routines, allocate and free an
ASN1_OBJECT structure, which represents an ASN1 OBJECT IDENTIFIER.

ASN1_OBJECT_new() allocates and initializes a ASN1_OBJECT structure.

ASN1_OBJECT_free() frees up the B<ASN1_OBJECT> structure B<a>.

=head1 NOTES

Although ASN1_OBJECT_new() allocates a new ASN1_OBJECT structure it
is almost never used in applications. The ASN1 object utility functions
such as OBJ_nid2obj() are used instead.

=head1 RETURN VALUES

If the allocation fails, ASN1_OBJECT_new() returns B<NULL> and sets an error
code that can be obtained by L<ERR_get_error(3)|ERR_get_error(3)>.
Otherwise it returns a pointer to the newly allocated structure.

ASN1_OBJECT_free() returns no value.

=head1 SEE ALSO

L<ERR_get_error(3)|ERR_get_error(3)>, L<d2i_ASN1_OBJECT(3)|d2i_ASN1_OBJECT(3)>

=head1 HISTORY

ASN1_OBJECT_new() and ASN1_OBJECT_free() are available in all versions of SSLeay and OpenSSL.
