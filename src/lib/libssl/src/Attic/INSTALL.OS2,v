@remove some orphanes:
- stuff which was (wrongly) contained within the -bopenbsd import,
  because it happened to have existed earlier in openbsd
- stuff which was (correctly) contained within the -bopenbsd
  import, and we removed in -bmirbsd

 Installation on OS/2
 --------------------

 You need to have the following tools installed:

  * EMX GCC
  * PERL
  * GNU make


 To build the makefile, run

 > os2\os2-emx

 This will configure OpenSSL and create OS2-EMX.mak which you then use to 
 build the OpenSSL libraries & programs by running

 > make -f os2-emx.mak

 If that finishes successfully you will find the libraries and programs in the
 "out" directory.

 Alternatively, you can make a dynamic build that puts the library code into
 crypto.dll and ssl.dll by running

 > make -f os2-emx-dll.mak

 This will build the above mentioned dlls and a matching pair of import
 libraries in the "out_dll" directory along with the set of test programs
 and the openssl application.
