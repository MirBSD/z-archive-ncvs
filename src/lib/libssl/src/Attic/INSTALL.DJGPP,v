 INSTALLATION ON THE DOS PLATFORM WITH DJGPP
 -------------------------------------------

 Openssl has been ported to DOS, but only with long filename support. If
 you wish to compile on native DOS with 8+3 filenames, you will have to
 tweak the installation yourself, including renaming files with illegal
 or duplicate names.

 You should have a full DJGPP environment installed, including the
 latest versions of DJGPP, GCC, BINUTILS, BASH, etc. This package
 requires that PERL and BC also be installed.

 All of these can be obtained from the usual DJGPP mirror sites, such
 as "ftp://ftp.simtel.net/pub/simtelnet/gnu/djgpp". You also need to
 have the WATT-32 networking package installed before you try to compile
 openssl. This can be obtained from "http://www.bgnett.no/~giva/".
 The Makefile assumes that the WATT-32 code is in the directory
 specified by the environment variable WATT_ROOT. If you have watt-32
 in directory "watt32" under your main DJGPP directory, specify
 WATT_ROOT="/dev/env/DJDIR/watt32".

 To compile openssl, start your BASH shell. Then configure for DOS by
 running "./Configure" with appropriate arguments. The basic syntax for
 DOS is:
 ./Configure no-threads --prefix=/dev/env/DJDIR DJGPP
 
 You may run out of DPMI selectors when running in a DOS box under
 Windows. If so, just close the BASH shell, go back to Windows, and
 restart BASH. Then run "make" again.

 Building openssl under DJGPP has been tested with DJGPP 2.03,
 GCC 2.952, GCC 2.953, perl 5.005_02 and perl 5.006_01.
