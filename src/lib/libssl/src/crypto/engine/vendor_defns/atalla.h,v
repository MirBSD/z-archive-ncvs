@/* This header declares the necessary definitions for using the exponentiation
 * acceleration capabilities of Atalla cards. The only cryptographic operation
 * is performed by "ASI_RSAPrivateKeyOpFn" and this takes a structure that
 * defines an "RSA private key". However, it is really only performing a
 * regular mod_exp using the supplied modulus and exponent - no CRT form is
 * being used. Hence, it is a generic mod_exp function in disguise, and we use
 * it as such.
 *
 * Thanks to the people at Atalla for letting me know these definitions are
 * fine and that they can be reproduced here.
 *
 * Geoff.
