# This program looks for texinfo snippets in source files and other
# files, and builds per-category files with entries sorted in
# alphabetical order.

# The syntax it looks for is lines starting with '@@def' in *.c and
# other files (see TEXIFILES in Makefile.in).  Entries are terminated
# at the next @@def* (which begins a new entry) or, for C files, a line
# that begins with '*/' without leading spaces (this assumes that the
# texinfo snippet is within a C-style /* */ comment).
