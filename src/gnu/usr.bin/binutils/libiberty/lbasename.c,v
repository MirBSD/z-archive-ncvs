@@deftypefn Replacement {const char*} lbasename (const char *@@var{name})

Given a pointer to a string containing a typical pathname
(@@samp{/usr/src/cmd/ls/ls.c} for example), returns a pointer to the
last component of the pathname (@@samp{ls.c} in this case).  The
returned pointer is guaranteed to lie within the original
string.  This latter fact is not true of many vendor C
libraries, which return special strings or modify the passed
strings for particular input.

In particular, the empty string returns the same empty string,
and a path ending in @@code{/} returns the empty string after it.
