@This directory contains header files necessary to build a thread-aware GDB on
systems based on OSF's CMA threads package.

The latest version of these header files are available for free from:

	http://www.osf.org/mall/dce/SW-code

Currently, the only port of GDB which supports CMA threads is HP/UX-10.10.

@The GNU Debugger 6.3.50-current, from
 ftp://sources.redhat.com/pub/gdb/snapshots/current/gdb-weekly-6.3.50.20050107.tar.bz2

only the gdb/ subdirectory, gdb/testsuite/ removed.

Luckily, this time it doesn't depend on a different libbfd than
the one we deliver with GNU binutils...
