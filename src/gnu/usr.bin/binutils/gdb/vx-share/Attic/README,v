@The files in this directory are shared with Wind River Systems' VxWorks
debug stub.  This stub runs in the realtime system, as a process, and
waits for net connections from GDB's and DBX's and such.

Do not change these files without coordinating with Wind River Systems
in Alameda, California.  Talk to postmaster@@wrs.com to find out who 
currently maintains GDB for them.

@The GNU Debugger 6.3.50-current, from
 ftp://sources.redhat.com/pub/gdb/snapshots/current/gdb-weekly-6.3.50.20050107.tar.bz2

only the gdb/ subdirectory, gdb/testsuite/ removed.

Luckily, this time it doesn't depend on a different libbfd than
the one we deliver with GNU binutils...
