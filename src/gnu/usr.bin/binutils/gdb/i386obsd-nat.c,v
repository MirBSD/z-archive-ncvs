     important for OpenBSD, since it uses a different memory layout
     than NetBSD, yet we cannot distinguish between the two.

@The GNU Debugger 6.3.50-current, from
 ftp://sources.redhat.com/pub/gdb/snapshots/current/gdb-weekly-6.3.50.20050107.tar.bz2

only the gdb/ subdirectory, gdb/testsuite/ removed.

Luckily, this time it doesn't depend on a different libbfd than
the one we deliver with GNU binutils...
