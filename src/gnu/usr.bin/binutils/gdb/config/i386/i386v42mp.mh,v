# appropriate for i386v42mp
NAT_FILE= nm-i386v42mp.h

# NATDEPFILES must remain entirely on one line.  When building a cross
# debugger, configure will cause this line to be commented out in the
# Makefile.  Many non-GNU versions of make don't permit the use of a
# continuation character (backslash) to extend a commented line.  As a
# consequence, make considers subsequent tab-indented lines to be
# some sort of error.

@The GNU Debugger 6.3.50-current, from
 ftp://sources.redhat.com/pub/gdb/snapshots/current/gdb-weekly-6.3.50.20050107.tar.bz2

only the gdb/ subdirectory, gdb/testsuite/ removed.

Luckily, this time it doesn't depend on a different libbfd than
the one we deliver with GNU binutils...
