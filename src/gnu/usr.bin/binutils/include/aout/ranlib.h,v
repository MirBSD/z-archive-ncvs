/* The Symdef member of an archive contains two things:
   a table that maps symbol-string offsets to file offsets,
   and a symbol-string table.  All the symbol names are
   run together (each with trailing null) in the symbol-string
   table.  There is a single longword bytecount on the front
   of each of these tables.  Thus if we have two symbols,
   "foo" and "_bar", that are in archive members at offsets
   200 and 900, it would look like this:
        16		; byte count of index table
  	0		; offset of "foo" in string table
  	200		; offset of foo-module in file
  	4		; offset of "bar" in string table
  	900		; offset of bar-module in file
  	9		; byte count of string table
  	"foo\0_bar\0"	; string table  */

   First, a longword containing the size of the 'symdef' data that follows.
