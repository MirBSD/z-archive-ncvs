@Fri Jul  3 15:06:40 1998  Jarkko Hietaniemi  <jhi@@iki.fi>

	- Integrated IPC::SysV 1.03 to Perl 5.004_69.

Change 142 on 1998/05/31 by <gbarr@@pobox.com> (Graham Barr)

	- Changed SHMLBA from a constSUB to an XS sub as on some systems it is not
	  a constant
	- Added a missing MODULE line to SysV.xs so ftok is defined in IPC::SysV

Change 138 on 1998/05/23 by <gbarr@@pobox.com> (Graham Barr)

	Applied patch from Jarkko Hietaniemi to add constats for UNICOS
	
	Reduced size of XS object by changing constant sub definition
	into a loop
	
	Updated POD to include ftok()

Change 135 on 1998/05/18 by <gbarr@@pobox.com> (Graham Barr)

	applied changes from Jarkko Hietaniemi <jhi@@iki.fi> to add
	new constants and ftok
	
	fixed to compile with >5.004_50
	
	surrounded newCONSTSUB with #ifndef as perl now defines this itself
