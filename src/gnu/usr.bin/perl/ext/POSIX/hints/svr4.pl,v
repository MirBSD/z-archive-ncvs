@# For NCR MP-RAS systems with uname -a output like the following:
#	foo foo 4.0 3.0 3441 Pentium III(TM)-ISA/PCI
#	foo foo 4.0 3.0 4400 Pentium II(TM)-ISA/PCI
#	foo foo 4.2 1.1.2 shg2 386at
# the system needs to explicitly link against -lmw to pull in some
# symbols such as _mwoflocheckl and possibly others.
# For the first two, Configure sets archname='3441-svr4.0' or '4400-svr4.0'.
# The regex below is an attempt to get both systems as well as
# any reasonable future permutations.
# Thanks to Doug Hendricks for the original info.
#  (See hints/svr4.sh for more details.)

# A better NCR MP-RAS test, thanks to W. Geoffrey Rommel, is to
