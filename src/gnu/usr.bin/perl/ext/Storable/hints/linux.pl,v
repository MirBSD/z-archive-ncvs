@# gcc -O3 (and higher) can cause code produced from Storable.xs that
# dumps core immediately in recurse.t and retrieve.t, in is_storing()
# and last_op_in_netorder(), respectively.  In both cases the cxt is
# full of junk (and according to valgrind the cxt was never stack'd,
# malloc'd or free'd).  Observed in Debian 3.0 x86, with gccs 2.95.4
# 20011002 and 3.3, and in Redhat 7.1 with gcc 3.3.1. The failures
# happen only for unthreaded builds, threaded builds work okay.
