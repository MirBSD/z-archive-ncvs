=head1 NAME

perlglob.bat - a more capable perlglob.exe replacement

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    @@perlfiles = glob  "..\\pe?l/*.p?";
    print <..\\pe?l/*.p?>;

    # more efficient version
    > perl -MFile::DosGlob=glob -e "print <../pe?l/*.p?>"

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This file is a portable replacement for perlglob.exe.  It
is largely compatible with perlglob.exe (the Microsoft setargv.obj
version) in all but one respect--it understands wildcards in
directory components.

It prints null-separated filenames to standard output.

For details of the globbing features implemented, see
L<File::DosGlob>.

While one may replace perlglob.exe with this, usage by overriding
CORE::glob with File::DosGlob::glob should be much more efficient,
because it avoids launching a separate process, and is therefore
strongly recommended.  See L<perlsub> for details of overriding
builtins.
