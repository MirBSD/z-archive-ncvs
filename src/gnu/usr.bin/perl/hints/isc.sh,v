@#  isc.sh
#  Interactive Unix Versions 3 and 4. 
#  Compile perl entirely in posix mode.

# Use Configure -Dcc=gcc to use gcc
#

# We don't want to explicitly mention -lc (since we're using POSIX mode.)
# We also don't want -lx (the Xenix compatability libraries.) The only
# thing that it seems to pick up is chsize(), which has been reported to
# not work.  chsize() can also be implemented via fcntl() in perl (if you
# define -D_SYSV3).  We'll leave in -lPW since it's harmless.  Some
# extension might eventually need it for alloca, though perl doesn't use
# it.

# symbols hidden by name-space pollution rules.  This raises some
# compilation "redefinition" warnings, but they appear harmless.
