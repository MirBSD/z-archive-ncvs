# Can't assume too much about the string returned by crypt(),

# string matter.
#
# HISTORICALLY the results started with the first two bytes of the salt,
# followed by 11 bytes from the set [./0-9A-Za-z], and only the first
# eight characters mattered, but those are probably no more safe
# bets, given alternative encryption/hashing schemes like MD5,
# C2 (or higher) security schemes, and non-UNIX platforms.
