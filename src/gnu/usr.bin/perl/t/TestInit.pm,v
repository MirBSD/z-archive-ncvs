@# This is a replacement for the old BEGIN preamble which heads (or
# should head) up every core test program to prepare it for running.
# Now instead of:
#
# BEGIN {
#   chdir 't' if -d 't';
#   @@INC = '../lib';
# }
#
# t/TEST will use -MTestInit.  You may "use TestInit" in the test
# programs but it is not required.
#
# P.S. This documentation is not in POD format in order to avoid
# problems when there are fundamental bugs in perl.
