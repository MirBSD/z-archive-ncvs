#__USAGE
#%C	key library name ...
#	Crude cover for wlib to be compatible with ar
#	Supports the following key letters:
#	qcru
#	ru  replace existing modules. u indicates only replace
#	    those which are newer
#	c   create the library (kinda moot)
#	q   quickly append to the end.
#
#This is a crude cover, but it has proved sufficient for many
#ports. Rather than attempt to implement subtleties of the
#ar syntax, I simply create a new library under all
#circumstances. A much more thorough cover is available from
#http://www.fdma.com/pub/qnx/porting/ar
#
#Note that Watcom 10.6 supports ar directly, so this
#cover is not necessary.
#
#Increased the record size to 32 to accomodate a large library
#in the perl 5.003 distribution
#
#Submitted by Norton T. Allen (allen@@huarp.harvard.edu)
