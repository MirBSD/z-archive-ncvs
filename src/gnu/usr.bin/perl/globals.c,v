/* This file exists to #include "perl.h" _ONCE_ with
 * PERL_IN_GLOBALS_C defined. That causes various global varaiables
 * in perl.h and other files it includes to be _defined_ (and initialized)
 * rather than just declared.
 *
 * There is a #include "perlapi.h" which makes use of the fact
 * that the object file created from this file will be included by linker
 * (to resolve global variables). perlapi.h mention various other "API"
 * functions not used by perl itself, but the functions get
 * pulled into the perl executable via the refrerence here.
 *
 * Two printf() like functions have also found their way here.
 * Most likely by analogy to the API scheme above (as perl doesn't
 * use them) but they probably belong elsewhere the obvious place
 * being in perlio.c
