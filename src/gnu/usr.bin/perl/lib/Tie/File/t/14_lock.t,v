# Check flock() feature

# This isn't a real test; it just checks to make sure we can call the method.
# It doesn't even check to make sure that the default behavior
# (LOCK_EX) is occurring.  This is because I don't know how to write a good
# portable test for flocking.  I checked the Perl core distribution,
# and found that Perl doesn't test flock either!
