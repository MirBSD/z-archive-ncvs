# So the tests can chdir around and not break @@INC.
# We use getcwd() because otherwise rel2abs will blow up under taint
# mode pre-5.8.  We detaint is so @@INC won't be tainted.  This is
# no worse, and probably better, than just shoving an untainted, 
# relative "blib/lib" onto @@INC.

=head1 NAME

ExtUtils::testlib - add blib/* directories to @@INC

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use ExtUtils::testlib;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

After an extension has been built and before it is installed it may be
desirable to test it bypassing C<make test>. By adding

    use ExtUtils::testlib;

to a test program the intermediate directories used by C<make> are
added to @@INC.
