=head1 NAME

ExtUtils::MakeMaker::vmsish - Platform agnostic vmsish.pm

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use just like vmsish.pm

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Until 5.8.0, vmsish.pm is only installed on VMS.  This means any code
which has 'use vmsish' in it won't even compile outside VMS.  This
makes ExtUtils::MM_VMS very hard to test.

ExtUtils::MakeMaker::vmsish is just a very thin wrapper around vmsish
which works just like it on VMS and everywhere else it does nothing.
