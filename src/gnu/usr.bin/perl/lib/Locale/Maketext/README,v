@README for Locale::Maketext
                                        Time-stamp: "2004-03-30 16:02:27 AST"

			   Locale::Maketext

Locale::Maketext is a base class providing a framework for
localization and inheritance-based lexicons, as described in my
article in The Perl Journal #13 (a corrected version of which appears
in this dist).


PREREQUISITES

This suite requires Perl 5.  It also requires a recent version
of I18N::LangTags.  MSWin users should also get Win32::Locale.
File::Findgrep is also useful example code, as is the rather
larger Apache::MP3 source (even if you don't run Apache).


INSTALLATION

You install Locale::Maketext, as you would install any Perl module
distribution, by running these commands:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

If you want to install a private copy of Maketext in your home directory,
then you should try to produce the initial Makefile with something
like this command:

  perl Makefile.PL LIB=~/perl

See perldoc perlmodinstall for more information.


DOCUMENTATION

See the pod in Locale::Maketext and Locale::Maketext::TPJ13,
and see also File::Findgrep.


SUPPORT

Questions, bug reports, useful code bits, and suggestions for
Worms should be sent to me at sburke@@cpan.org


AVAILABILITY

The latest version of Locale::Maketext is available from the
Comprehensive Perl Archive Network (CPAN).  Visit
<http://www.perl.com/CPAN/> to find a CPAN site near you.
