@=head1 NAME

Escape Sequences Test

=head1 DESCRIPTION

I am a stupid fool who puts naked < & > characters in my POD
instead of escaping them as E<lt> and E<gt>.

Here is some B<bold> text, some I<italic> plus F</etc/fstab>
file and something that looks like an E<lt>htmlE<gt> tag.
This is some C<$code($arg1)>.
