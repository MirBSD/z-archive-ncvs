=head1 NAME

Pod::Perldoc::ToXml - let Perldoc render Pod as XML

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  perldoc -o xml -d out.xml Some::Modulename

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This is a "plug-in" class that allows Perldoc to use
Pod::Simple::XMLOutStream as a formatter class.

This is actually a Pod::Simple::XMLOutStream subclass, and inherits
all its options.

You have to have installed Pod::Simple::XMLOutStream (from the Pod::Simple
dist), or this class won't work.
