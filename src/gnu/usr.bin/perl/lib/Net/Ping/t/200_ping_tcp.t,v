# Remote network test using tcp protocol.

# NOTE:
#   Network connectivity will be required for all tests to pass.
#   Firewalls may also cause some tests to fail, so test it
#   on a clear network.  If you know you do not have a direct
#   connection to remote networks, but you still want the tests
#   to pass, use the following:
#
# $ PERL_CORE=1 make test

use Test;
use Net::Ping;

# Test on the default port
ok $p -> ping("localhost");

# Change to use the more common web port.
# This will pull from /etc/services on UNIX.
# (Make sure getservbyname works in scalar context.)
