@work over most of the changes MirOS has done, and add
the new or copied/moved files
@
text
@This subdirectory contains some additional files which are necessary
(or at least useful) when compiling Perl on MiNT.

"Makefile" and "pwd.c" will build and install a fixed version of the
pwd command if your system pwd is broken.

The header files are wrappers around broken system header files.  Make
sure that this directory stands at first place in your include path
when compiling Perl.

The file system.c is an enhanced version of the system() function
in the MiNTLib.  It is strongly recommended that you insert this
version into your libc before you compile Perl (see README.MiNT
in the toplevel directory for details).
