VMS::Stdio, which provides access from Perl to VMS-specific
stdio functions.  For more specific documentation of its
function, please see the pod section of Stdio.pm.

===> Installation

This extension, like most Perl extensions, should be installed
by copying the files in this directory to a location *outside*
the Perl distribution tree, and then saying

    $ perl Makefile.PL  ! Build Descrip.MMS for this extension
    $ MMK               ! Build the extension
    $ MMK test          ! Run its regression tests
    $ MMK install       ! Install required files in public Perl tree
