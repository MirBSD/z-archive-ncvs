     Copying and distribution of this file, with or without modification,
     are permitted in any medium without royalty provided the copyright
     notice and this notice are preserved.

For generic installation instructions on compiling and installing this
Automake-based distribution, please read the file `INSTALL.generic'.

Installation notes specific to Texinfo:

* texinfo.tex and the other *.tex files are not installed by `make
  install'.  This is because there is no reliable way to know where to
  install them.  Instead, you have to run an additional make command
  after the normal make install:
    make TEXMF=/your/texmf install-tex
  texinfo.tex is installed in ${TEXMF}/tex/texinfo/texinfo.tex, etc.

* On the other hand, if you're maintaining a TeX distribution, you don't
  want your users to see the installation warnings, because you already
  have the files installed.  (And you're keeping them up to date, right?)
  In this case, run configure --disable-install-warnings, or set
  enable_install_warnings=no in the environment.

* On MacOSX, if configure fails with the error:
	ac_cv_build='config.sub: invalid option -apple-darwin7.2.0
this is probably because your uname -p is returning "unknown".  Use
/usr/bin/uname instead.

* For instructions on compiling this distribution with DJGPP tools
  for MS-DOS and MS-Windows, see the file djgpp/README.

* The Info tree uses a file `dir' as its root node; the `dir-example'
  file in this distribution is included as a possible starting point.
  Use it, modify it, or ignore it just as you like.

* You can create a file texinfo.cnf to be read by TeX when
  processing Texinfo manuals.  For example, you might like to use
  @@afourpaper by default.  See the `Preparing for TeX' node in
  texinfo.txi for more details.  You don't have to create the file if
  you have nothing to put in it.

* If your info files are not in $prefix/info, you may wish to add a line
#define DEFAULT_INFOPATH "/mydir1:/mydir2:..."
  to config.h after running configure.
