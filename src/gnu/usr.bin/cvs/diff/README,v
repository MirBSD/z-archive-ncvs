@The files in this directory come from the GNU diffutils project
<http://savannah.gnu.org/projects/diffutils/>/<mailto:bug-gnu-utils@@gnu.org>,
and, if they don't, they should.

What this means is that bug fixes and enhancements to this code should be sent
to the diffutils project and then reimported here after the diffutils
developers approve and adopt the change.  Changes should not be made locally
without good reason!
