# Why are these dates tested?
#
# February 29, 2003
#   Is not a leap year - should be invalid.
#
# 2004-12-40
#   Make sure get_date does not "roll" date forward to January 9th.  Some
#   versions have been known to do this.
#
# Dec-5-1972
#   This is my birthday.  :)
#
# 3/29/1974
# 1996/05/12 13:57:45
#   Because.
#
# 12-05-12
#   This will be my 40th birthday.  Ouch.  :)
#
# 05/12/96
#   Because.
#
# third tuesday in March, 2078
#   Wanted this to work.

#   Playing near the UNIX Epoch boundry condition to make sure date rolling
#   is also disabled there.

# 1996-12-12 1 month
#   Test a relative date.
#
# Tue Jan 19 03:14:07 2038 +0000
#   For machines with 31-bit time_t, any date past this date will be an
#   invalid date. So, any test date with a value greater than this
#   time is not portable.
#
# Feb. 29, 2096 4 years
#   4 years from this date is _not_ a leap year, so Feb. 29th does not exist.
#
# Feb. 29, 2096 8 years
#   8 years from this date is a leap year, so Feb. 29th does exist,
#   but on many hosts with 32-bit time_t types time, this test will
#   fail. So, this is not a portable test.
