# BTW, i wrote a perl script that is similar to 'nfpipe' except that in
# addition to logging to a file it provides a command line option for mailing
# change notices to a group of users. Obviously you probably wouldn't want
# to mail every change. But there may be certain directories that are commonly
# accessed by a group of users who would benefit from an email notice. 
# Especially if they regularly beat on the same directory. Anyway if you 
# think anyone would be interested here it is.
