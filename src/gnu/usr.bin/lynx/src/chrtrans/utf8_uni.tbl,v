# This one is not really much of a "translation table", it mostly just
# tells Lynx that "utf-8" is Unicode/UCS2 encoded in UTF8.  Note that
# "unicode-1-1-utf-8" and "utf8" are treated as synonyms.
#
#The MIME name of this charset.
Mutf-8

#Name as a Display Charset (used on Options screen)
OUNICODE (UTF-8)

# Some kind of raw Unicode?
# Use 6 for for really "raw" 16bit UCS-2, 7 for UTF-8, ...

# most of these codes currently don't make much sense in a *.tbl file,
# but for completeness (from UCDefs.h):
#  #define UCT_ENC_7BIT 0
#  #define UCT_ENC_8BIT 1
#  #define UCT_ENC_8859 2
#  #define UCT_ENC_8BIT_C0 3
#  #define UCT_ENC_MAYBE2022 4
#  #define UCT_ENC_CJK 5
#  #define UCT_ENC_16BIT 6
#  #define UCT_ENC_UTF8 7

R 7

#Shall this become the "default" translation?
#There has to be exactly one table marked as "default".
Default NO

# Don't fall back to default table for unicode -> 8bit
Fallback NO
