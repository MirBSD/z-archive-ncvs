@LYNX SUPPORT FOR SOCKETSHR/NETLIB			28-AUG-1996
---------------------------------


What is SocketShr?
------------------

SOCKETSHR is Eckhart Meyer's socket library interface to the MadGoat NETLIB
package, which provides a vendor-independent interface to the VMS TCP/IP
transports.  Using this, the same image will run over any of the available
packages, including UCX, Multinet, CMU, Pathway access and TCPWARE.

SocketShr and NETLIB are separately available libraries that MUST be installed
before LYNX can use them.


How to get NETLIB and SOCKETSHR
-------------------------------

FTP:

   ftp://ftp.kcl.ac.uk/default/socketshr.*
   ftp://ftp.wku.edu/fileserv/socketshr.zip
   ftp://ftp.spc.edu/macro32/savesets/socketshr.zip

   ftp://ftp.kcl.ac.uk/madgoat/netlib.*
   ftp://ftp.wku.edu/madgoat/netlib017.zip
   ftp://ftp.spc.edu/macro32/savesets/netlib017.zip


By E-Mail:
   send the following commands in a mail message:

     SEND SOCKETSHR.PACKAGE
     SEND NETLIB.PACKAGE

   To:
     vmsserv @@ kcl.ac.uk

Other server's may also contain these packages.

NETLIB is copyright of MadGoat Software; SOCKETSHR is copyright of Eckhart
meyer.


Preliminary Setup of SOCKETSHR
------------------------------

Once SOCKETSHR has been installed, TWO logical names should be defined:

    SOCKETSHR 		Point to the appropriate shareable image
    SOCKETSHR_LIBRARY	Point to the directory containing SOCKETSHR.H
    			and IOCTL.H

Both should be defined /system /exec


Building LYNX
-------------

Run the BUILD.COM procedures and select the SOCKETSHR_TCP option.  This will
build an image that will run over the SOCKETSHR/NETLIB routines.
