@This document describes the required steps to install Lynx on VMS systems
which use the CMU TCP/IP package.

The interface to CMU is implemented via Mike O'Malley's excellent LIBCMU socket
library for VMS.  It is not included in the Lynx distribution as it is quite
large and freely available from:
	ftp://kermit.columbia.edu/vms-libcmu/ckvlcmu.hex

This is a hexified version of the LIBCMU.BCK saveset.

All LIBCMU files (library and include files) are assumed to be in the
CMUIP_ROOT:[SYSLIB] directory.  Ensure the following LIBCMU files are
placed appropriately on your system:

	cmuip_root:[syslib]ioctl.h
	cmuip_root:[syslib]libcmu.olb

Beyond this, follow the same INSTALLATION procedures that you would for any
VMS Lynx compilation.

REMAINING PROBLEMS:
	At this time, the FTP Lynx code does not appear to work; it is believed
	that this problem is due to an as of yet unresolved problem with the
	LIBCMU 1.2 library.  The getsockname routine returns all zeros for the
	local address portion and results in the system sending an invalid
	PORT command to the remote end.

	Telnet, tn3270 and rlogin support are not yet implemented.
