 * A skeleton driver for the Brooktree BT445 ``Chameleon'' RAMDAC found
 * on the early Tadpole SPARCbook 3 machines.

 * It will not perform anything by itself, but frame buffer drivers can use
 * its softc structure to be able to access the RAMDAC themselves - creating
 * a ramdac API for just this specific case of separate attachments is not
