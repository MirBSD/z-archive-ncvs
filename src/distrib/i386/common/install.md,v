You will now create at least a single MBR partition to contain the disklabel.
This *PRIMARY* partition must have an ID of 27 hex (or 0xA9 for compatibility
reasons) and NOT overlap other partitions. You can create other MBR partitions,
primary or extended ones, to contain the filesystems, but these must *NOT* be
of type 27, A6, A5 or A9. It is recommended they be of type DB (CP/M-86), and
they are only used to mark the space as USED for other operating systems that
still need MBR partitions. BSD exclusively uses the data in the disklabel to
determine where filesystems are, and uses the MBR partition exclusively to
determine where on the disk the disklabel is positioned.

The 'manual' command describes all the fdisk commands in detail.

$(fdisk ${_disk})
__EOT
	fdisk -e ${_disk}

	cat <<__EOT
Here is the partition information you chose:

$(fdisk ${_disk})
__EOT
}

md_prep_disklabel() {
	local _disk=$1
	md_prep_fdisk $_disk
	cat <<__EOT

You will now create a MirBSD disklabel inside the MirBSD MBR partition. The
disklabel defines how MirBSD splits up the MBR partition (rather, the whole
disk) into MirBSD slices in which filesystems and swap space are created.

The offsets used in the disklabel are ABSOLUTE, i.e. relative to the
start of the disk, NOT the start of the MirBSD MBR partition.

If you have created a split space, i.e. one partition of type 27 and one or
more partitions of type (e.g.) DB, use the command b<return>0<return>*<return>
to enable using the entire disk for MirBSD. Be sure to create slices mapping
the filesystems of any other operating systems in order to not overwrite them.

You will now create a single MBR partition to contain your OpenBSD data. This
partition must have an id of 'A6'; must *NOT* overlap other partitions; and
must be marked as the only active partition.
